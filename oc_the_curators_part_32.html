<p>The council debated for a couple of weeks while M and I had our own arguments.  I wasn't surprised when they formally asked us to help them raise their technology.  At the same time I was almost ready to walk back our offer, except that I'd also been talking to other natives about the issue, and at some point someone told me that it had been seventy thousand years since they rejected the Curators' Gift of the nanites.</p>

<p>Seventy thousand years of children and old and unlucky people dying of curable diseases and treatable injuries.  Seventy thousand years of reading by candlelight and farming with draft animals and knowing there was a galactic civilization but being excluded from it.  Seventy thousand years of bodies stacked like cordwood and dreams tossed in a river of pride.  What could you say to such a situation?</p>

<p>"It would be our honor to help you," is what I said.</p>

<p>"We still have to get knowledge for them.  We don't have the training to raise them from this point to where our own training becomes useful."</p>

<p>"I have to go to Earth," I said heavily.</p>

<p>"You can't go to Earth," M said very flatly.</p>

<p>"Of course I can.  There's nothing to stop me except the fear of what might happen to me if I'm noticed there.  But I've realized in the last few days that with this fur, which we asked for so we could pass unnoticed among aliens, we look more like aliens than humans.  I won't go back to Earth as myself.  I will go as an alien."</p>

<p>"We can go."</p>

<p>"No, you need to stay behind in case I fail.  You might have to figure it out the hard way but at least you know the end game.  You actually know how to make a fold drive.  I have a pretty good idea what I have to do, and our assets have continued to increase at regular interest as we've gotten older.  We're fairly wealthy and should be able to afford what we need."</p>

<p>"If you draw on those accounts you won't be an alien any more.  If anyone has tracers on us, and you know they do, that will draw them right to you."</p>

<p>"Well we don't have anything else, and I consider it a thing we have to do."</p>

<p>In the end she relented; for her, as a technologist, she saw a society that was stable and harmonious.  For me, as a doctor, I saw all kinds of preventable illness and death.  We agreed on a plan.  She would fly me to Hyacinth, which had regular trade with Earth via their landable fold ships which eliminated the orbit-to-ground transfer bottleneck.  And I would rendezvous with her when I had gotten what we needed.</p>

<p>None of the alien worlds seem to have what we could consider an economy, except in some kind of fantasy thought experiment.  Even though I was from a nonexistent race with no homeworld or resources, all it took was presenting at the terminal and making up an access code and I had a berth of standard type 23, best suited for humans as well as a range of other similar species.</p>

<p>I was early and seven days were reserved for loading the ship, so I spent them the least conspicuous way possible, getting drunk and making small talk with the other passengers at the bar.  Nearly all of them spoke at least a little Common.  I was very careful to be coy about my own origins; I quickly learned that this is actually a thing among the aliens, and claiming to be from a quarantined world was an accepted way to answer "none of your business" to the question "where are you from."  It also isn't unheard of for typically unmodest aliens to wear codpieces to protect their more sensitive bits, and that was good because with a little makeup on the bare skin of my face and hands those bits were my most obvious human tell.</p>

<p>After two days I returned from the bar to find my old acquaintance the human-form Curator in my cabin.  "I can't believe my cover is already blown," I said dejectedly as I sat down on the bed.</p>

<p>"Only with us, and your secret is safe with us," he said.  "I heard you were drinking that swill they serve down at the bar and thought you might prefer a real drink."  He pulled a fifth of Johnny Walker Blue from a brown paper bag and I got us cups.</p>

<p>"So how are you here?"</p>

<p>"Our associate here noticed your arrival.  Unscheduled fold activity, and she could tell it wasn't a nanite fold drive or one of ours.  She guessed correctly that it must be human and contacted me.  The ship schedules made it obvious what you were up to and so we did a local aerial drone search and found your ship.  It looks awfully familiar, but doesn't have the same fold drive it did back in the day."</p>

<p>"Long story," I said.</p>

<p>"So we contacted our associate on 829166.  I have to wonder why you are risking so much to help them."</p>

<p>I told him.</p>

<p>"Have you asked yourself who will do all the work of re-creating your technology?"</p>

<p>"I don't know.  Maybe they will decide it's not worth the bother.  But they don't have billions of people to feed and fight.  They can focus their energy on what they decide is important.  There's only one way to find out."</p>

<p>He poured us another round.  "J, there is something I need to tell you about your own people.  I know you wonder why we denied you the gifts and our Mark."</p>

<p>"I had long given up any hope you would ever explain that," I said.</p>

<p>"There have been talks at high levels among my people.  I know you have noticed that only Earth humans use money.  Even your colonies don't, because they had to be nanite based to get them developed so quickly.  We meant nanites to create what your people call a 'post-scarcity' society.  Nobody needs to want for any necessity of life on a world with a robust nanite infrastructure.  There are exceptions, like the raiders on their low metallicity world which poorly feeds the nanite infrastructure, but for the most part it works.  This is a very, very old design.  Older by half than your own planet."</p>

<p>"Okay, so why deny us?"</p>

<p>"In order for it to work, all of our children need a mechanism to avoid ruinous overpopulation.  We usually apply this when we apply our Mark, and the most common form is for either fertility or libido to decrease in a high population situation.  The Hyacinth are proud of their skyscraper but those who spend a lot of time in it are finding that they need to move to the country for a few years if they want to reproduce.  And it's long been understood that the long-term crews of fold ships don't tend to reproduce."</p>

<p>"We don't have any limitations like that."</p>

<p>"No, not like that.  Several hundred thousand years ago, when it became clear your ancestors might enter the critical path, it was unclear that our usual methods would sufficiently curb your aggressive tendencies.  But one of us made the calculation that for your race the population limiting control could be war.  There was no need for us to do anything, and no danger that you would develop high technology and make wider trouble due to the constant disruption of your own nascent civilization."</p>

<p>"I think your colleague got that wrong," I said carefully.</p>

<p>"We have rarely been so spectacularly wrong about anything in all of our history," he said.  "We were confident we had it right when your Roman empire collapsed, as we expected.  But when the Renaissance occurred we were completely surprised.  At that point your technology became driven by your impulses to war and greed, and advanced far more quickly than we had ever seen.  Capitalism brilliantly exploited your own worst tendencies to drive your expansion.  Watching your progress for the last few hundred years has been like watching an explosion that builds more things than it tears down.  It defies everything we thought we knew about growth and civilization.  Most of our children take thousands of your years to progress from steam power to the fold drive, even with nanites to make it easy.  You did it without our help in the blink of an eye."</p>

<p>I extended my empty cup and he poured us another shot.</p>

<p>"J, why haven't you named 829166?"</p>

<p>"I'm trying to keep a low profile, and I noticed awhile back that when I name something it tends to attract attention."</p>

<p>"Your hosts aren't on the microfold, though.  And your secret is safe with my people.  We are intensely curious as to how you will pursue this."</p>

<p>"Prometheus," I said.</p>

<p>"That isn't quite right," the Curator admonished.  "You are playing the role of Prometheus, and the children of 829166 are playing the role of humans in this story."</p>

<p>"Still the closest I can think of.  And 'Prometheans' has a nice ring to it."</p>

<p>"All right.  For the good of the Prometheans, you are going on a false identity to the most securely watched, paranoid, identity-obsessed, and technologically advanced world in the galaxy.  You'll need money."</p>

<p>"M and I have money."</p>

<p>"Money that is linked to your real identities.  The people who covet what the Witnesses gave you will trace that in half an hour."  He produced a credit chip.  "Use this instead.  We are old and have vast resources too, and if they try to trace <em>that</em> money they will back off in a hurry.  My people will consider you good for the loan."</p>

<p>"I was a bit worried about that," I admitted, and I accepted another shot.  "I don't know how to thank you."</p>

<p>"Thank us by making it interesting.  My ability to monitor you on Earth is limited these days.  If your mission goes south I may be able to help, but I can't promise anything.  We honestly want to find out what you can do with the Prometheans.  We think we know what happened with humans now, but what you are trying on 829166 is similarly unprecedented.  I would not be the one to predict that it can't work after what your own people did."</p>

<p>He left the bottle, and I finished it off.  We were still two days from folding.</p>

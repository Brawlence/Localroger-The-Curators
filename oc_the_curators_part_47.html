<p><em>Five Seconds Later</em></p>

<p>It was raining pretty hard.</p>

<p>"Sorry about the weather," the Curator said.  "There are other places I could have brought you on other colonies, but this is the most illustrative.  This is Research City, human colony of Pretoria.  We are about ten klicks from the lab where the Sunlight Cannon was developed."</p>

<p>Across the street was an obvious retail establishment with signs advertising ELECTRONICS in five human languages.</p>

<p>As we crossed the street the Curator said, "This place gets everything state of the art from Earth because of the research contracts.  Pay attention to the specifications."</p>

<p>The basic wares had not changed much in 40 years.  There were phones and tablets, all flat slabs with bright displays and various accessories.  There were offers of data plans and various claims of coverage and rates.  I wasn't sure what the currency was worth so it was hard to tell what the prices meant.</p>

<p>Finally M looked up from the fine print on an ad for a workstation computer.  "This is some kind of joke, right?  These specifications are right from the start of our exile forty years ago."</p>

<p>"Battery performance was improved quite a bit in the early years while you were away," the Curator said.  "And there were manufacturing improvements from the fold drive research, but some of those were offset by resource availability problems.  The basic processor and memory tech is almost exactly the same as it was when you were last on Earth, and prices compared to other commodities are also similar.  By the way, I asked you to bring your own phones, why don't you check signal?"</p>

<p>"These still work?" M asked incredulously as the Curator nodded.  </p>

<p>"No significant improvements there either.  You could dial an emergency number that doesn't require a connection plan right now."</p>

<p>We walked up the street to a bar the Curator knew, and we ordered stiff drinks.  "What have our people been doing for the last four decades?" M asked.</p>

<p>"Humans have taught us much about how our mathematical models interlock.  Our models promised that war would limit your population, but you proved us wrong.  There are many reasons for that, all of them extraordinary.  Your fondness for clothing made it possible for you to expand to far more diverse regions of the Earth than most of our children manage to colonize of their own worlds.  Your tribalism and determination and quick imagination made it possible to weld yourselves together into large organizations to build new munitions, organize previously unknown defenses, and create new modes of manufacture and transportation.  And then there is capitalism."</p>

<p>We just looked at him.</p>

<p>"Our models also promised that your modern economic system would collapse, inevitably decaying back into feudalism, but ironically your penchant for blowing stuff up once in awhile in war saved it.  Your theorists correctly understood what our models said, which is that capitalism only works when there is constant exponential growth.  Some of your own thinkers understood the insanity of depending on this but what we didn't understand was that the occasional catastrophic reset could keep the exponential collapse at bay.  Your kind mourn the losses of your wars and natural disasters but you have actually needed those things.  The collapse of Earth's climate is the only thing that kept capitalism going as long as it did."</p>

<p>"If it was working so well, why did it stop?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You invented the fold drive.  You colonized the stars.  You sent your surplus population away, and most of them went willingly because the colonies were founded on our standards of stability and plenty via the nanite economy.  Still there was a lot of pride associated with being allowed to stay on Earth.  Today the population is around eight hundred million, and Earth is the only place in the galaxy where your advanced fold drives and other electronics are made.  The Hyacinth Consortium manages to make supergravity drives, but they have constant quality issues because nobody does fanatical devotion to an abstract procedure like humans.  We think the Prometheans will put the consortium out of business because while their product is inferior, it is so much easier to manufacture."</p>

<p>"That doesn't explain why humans stopped improving," M said.</p>

<p>"There was no longer any need.  With the historic pressures removed by the fold diaspora, all the capital consolidated around a few families who now control everything.  Your capitalist system finally decayed into feudalism, as our models insisted it should.  The ruling dynasties have no reason to engage in conflict because they have carved out an equitable arrangement between themselves.  They have nothing practical to gain by risking anything to try to take anything from each other."</p>

<p>"Earth is now feudal, but on a scale nobody has ever seen in billions of years.  Earth is both the most technologically advanced world and the closest thing to a slave world that exists in our galactic garden.  Humans produce fold drives and other electronics in return for raw materials and other considerations from many of our children.  The low-level economy is completely controlled by the oligarchs and surveillance is pervasive.  Dissident elements are easily detected and sent to the colonies."</p>

<p>"Such equitable arrangements didn't stop wars from developing in past human feudal societies," I pointed out.</p>

<p>"The four main geopolitical powers that exist now don't seem to have a taste for it, but we think you're right.  In the long term we don't think this is stable either.  But we don't have any idea how to fix it."</p>

<p>"In the past, I think that usually started with a revolution," M said.</p>

<p>"The revolutionaries are all here.  Transporting them is a much more humane solution than the historic alternatives, so there is little meaningful opposition to it.  An advanced system of propaganda keeps most of the people who remain on Earth proud to be citizens of their feudal nation-states and to be part of what they consider an extraordinary global project.  Which, to be honest, it is.  It just bothers us that something we don't think has long-term stability is becoming so important to so many of our other children."</p>

<p>"If there is a revolution they will fold Earth into Sol," M said dejectedly.</p>

<p>"All of the geopolitical players have fold span limiters to deter that," the Curator said.</p>

<p>She chugged the rest of her drink and signaled for another.  "That's human genius for you," she said with a burp.  "We have <em>four</em> fold span limiters on <em>one</em> world.  Because, being human, we need them."  And she laughed in a way that made it clear she didn't really find it funny.</p>

<p>"Why did you decide to tell us this?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nobody has any idea what to do about it.  You two are probably the most qualified individuals in the galaxy to brainstorm solutions.  In two or three years the Prometheans will demonstrate their fold ship and it will be time to let them go.  You have been so successful there we hope you will give us some guidance on other problems."</p>

<p>"Like the guys who don't build fold ships at all."</p>

<p>The Curator shrugged.  "We're pretty good at ironing things out but it's a big galaxy and so we do have a few issues."</p>

<p>"And thanks to the Witnesses we're probably going to live a long time, so we'll need <em>something</em> to do."  I couldn't tell whether M was being sarcastic or sincere.</p>

<p>"The need for something to do is what caused our ancestors to start Curating all those billions of years ago.  Don't underestimate it as a force for change.  Go to any other galaxy -- we have, once in awhile -- and they are all nearly sterile.  Here in the Milky Way we have a vibrant garden because our ancestors decided they preferred garden worlds to sterile boulders."</p>

<p>"If you've got so much experience, why do you think we can be any help at all?"</p>

<p>"Because you're human," he said.  "And if anyone can do something we don't think is possible, it's you."</p>

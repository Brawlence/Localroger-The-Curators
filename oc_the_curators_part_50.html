<p>The Curators arranged to fake citizenship for us, not in the United States of America but in the Russo-American Concordance, which included both North and South America, all of the previous USSR, and what had once been the European Union.  It was an insanely oppressive and xenophobic state that pretended to have elections but left it an open secret that people who voted the wrong way might just disappear.  To the colonies of course, ha-ha, but nobody really knew.</p>

<p>With the Curators' help hacking the system we managed to obtain ownership of a modest house on the outskirts of Terlingua, where the density of stuff worthy of being stolen was too low to attract the interest of the kleptocracy running that part of the world.  As we practiced daily learning to control our implants we also planted some very illegal nanites beneath a closet and let them carve out an underground retreat far larger than the house, and forty meters beneath the surface.  It wouldn't be invisible to ground-penetrating radar, but you'd have to suspect it was there first to make such a search worth doing.</p>

<p>Eight months later our mentor Curator invited us to return to the Top of the Mark in San Francisco.  By this time we could make the clandestine journey without his help, and as we took our seats he handed M and me two small gray sticks about ten centimeters long and a few millimeters in diameter.</p>

<p>"What are these?" M asked.</p>

<p>"They are the keys that allow me to remotely control your implants.  They make me your mentor and give me power over you as novices."</p>

<p>"And what are we supposed to do with them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You break them," he said with a smile.</p>

<p>I snapped mine, and it didn't just break in half; it dissolved into dust.  M followed suit.</p>

<p>"What has been destroyed today can never be reassembled," the Curator said.  "You are no longer novices.  You are now Curators.  Behold our galactic garden, and take your place among us as its stewards."</p>

<p>"So what happens now?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I think you were contemplating a visit to the Witnesses.  It will take a few hops and I can't do it for you any more.  You'll have to follow me.  But first, why not enjoy our cocktails?"</p>

<p>Later the Witnesses greeted us like long-lost friends, and we quickly found ourselves in the textile lab, which had grown considerably since our last visit.  "Your people may make nice fold drives but cloth is your species' true genius," the lab director told us.  "Considering what is going on on Earth we consider it imperative to learn and preserve as much as we can of your technology."</p>

<p>"We were looking for something like this," I said, and I popped up a review of comic book superhero costumes on my phone.</p>

<p>"We know the theory of this material but we have never made it," he said.  "An excellent learning opportunity.  What about the foot and hand wear?"</p>

<p>"Boots and gloves," M said.  "<em>Flat</em> boots in my case.  I'm not going into battle in heels.  And in leather if you can manage it."</p>

<p>"We don't make a frequent habit of making it for ourselves but we do have sources of suitable animal skin and we have tanning methods."</p>

<p>"And if possible, it should all be electroconductive.  That would help us avoid a lot of compensating factors when folding."</p>

<p>"We have coatings that can probably manage that."</p>

<p>After going over a few more details we found ourselves with orders to wait a few days.  Once we were done with the textilery our Curator suggested that there was somebody we might want to see.</p>

<p>"Or not," M said with a frown.  "Don't think I don't know what this is about."</p>

<p>Q was absorbed in meditation when we kind of barged in on him.  "Greetings," he said without looking up.  "M, I'm surprised you are willing to be in the same room with me."</p>

<p>"Things change," she said.</p>

<p>Q got up.  "So they do," he said.  "I have been granted the favor of entrance to the Witnesses' order.  Like the Curators they occasionally recruit aliens to their purpose."</p>

<p>"Considering what you once tried to do to them I find that mildly surprising, but then I remember it's the Witnesses we are talking about."</p>

<p>Q smiled and nodded.  "Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"Does your status as a Witness prevent you from participating in the history you are witnessing?" M asked.</p>

<p>"Not entirely.  I would have to consult with my master.  Ours is a long course of study, and I will be a student for a long time."</p>

<p>M sucked in her breath.  We had agreed on this, but I still wasn't sure she would be able to go through with it.  "Are you aware that we are also students?"</p>

<p>"I'm aware that you are not students any more.  You have my congratulations and, for what it might be worth, my blessing.  I think you will make fine Curators."</p>

<p>"Then you know we have a slightly used starship we have no use for any more."</p>

<p>"If it is still powered by 0104, maybe you should just destroy it.  As beautiful as the <em>Implausible Alibi</em> is it is still a dangerous artifact, and I'm the one being in the galaxy who proved that most decisively."</p>

<p>"We were actually thinking of asking you to pilot it for us," M said.  "Our fold implants do not allow us to carry much in the way of cargo, and there may be times when we will still need a ship."</p>

<p>Q sank to his knees and a few tears ran down his cheeks.  "I cannot imagine how you think I am worthy of such an honor."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think you're <em>worthy</em>," M said.  "But I do think you're capable and I do believe you've reformed, which isn't much but is something."</p>

<p>Q sobbed openly.  "I will have to ask my master, but..."</p>

<p>"No, we've asked her already.  You're cleared to come Witness what we're going to do.  They are positively splooging themselves over it."  Behind us the Curator chuckled.</p>

<p>He looked up.  "And what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"We are going to clean up the cesspool our home world has become.  I would think you would want in on that action anyway."</p>

<p>Tears streaming down his face, he nodded.</p>

<p>Back at the textilery, we looked ourselves over in the mirror.  They had done their usual amazing job and we really did look like cutouts from a superhero comic.  Our body suits were metallic silver and shimmered as we moved.  There was just one problem.</p>

<p>"Kind of bland," M said.  "We need some kind of signature."</p>

<p>"We decided every color was significant to something we didn't want to confuse ourselves with, and symbols were a similar problem."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but we just show up and kick ass like this nobody will remember why we're doing it."</p>

<p>"Well, why are we doing it?"</p>

<p>"To topple the decadent kleptocracy that has taken over the Earth."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a negative.  What's the positive?  What are we replacing it with?"</p>

<p>M stared hard at the mirror and then her eyes got wide.  "Not what we're really replacing it with!" she almost shouted.  "What the fuckers are most afraid of!"</p>

<p>"And that is...?"</p>

<p>"Crowns!  Let them think we're coming to take over their shit.  It's the one thing they will truly believe in and fear.  We'll call ourselves the King and Queen of Earth and say we are coming to claim our thrones.  We can always abdicate toward a more reasonable power once we have brought the assholes down."</p>

<p>"Not too eager to go into battle with several kilograms of gold sitting on my head," I said dubiously.</p>

<p>"How about titanium?" the Witness textiler suggested.</p>

<p>"And with the decorations as reflective motifs instead of gemstones?" M suggested, and the textiler nodded.</p>

<p>"This isn't our wheelhouse but I know who can do it for you," the Witness said, and an hour later we were in another lab with a metallurgist who measured our skulls and used what we would consider rather primitive tools to form a mockup of what our headgear would look like.</p>

<p>A week later we walked out of the foundry to find our Curator mentor waiting for us.  He opened his eyes wide and said, "Well, if it isn't the royal couple," with a chuckle.</p>

<p>Using new routines M had written into our fold implants we floated up from the floor using the supergravity effect and spread our arms.  "We will rule," we said, and we all had a good laugh.</p>

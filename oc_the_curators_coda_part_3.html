<p>"This wasn't made here," the jeweler said as soon as I showed him the pendant.  "There are only a few worlds in the galaxy where materials and workmanship of this quality are found.  Earth is of course one of them."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"The central disc is ceramic, which might mean it could be dated.  All the surrounding stones are sapphires.  The top two stones are a star sapphire cabochon and a very large faceted white, which is at this size and quality would be more rare than an equally clear diamond of the same size.  The other smaller stones get progressively brighter yellow as you circle the piece until you reach this larger orange piece and then the really big ruby and white.  The ruby would be even more fantastically rare than the white if it's natural."</p>

<p>"Any idea what the disc is?"</p>

<p>She set up a special blue light and got each of us a plate to look through.  Rotating the plate revealed patterns.  "Ceramic doesn't wear easily, but this piece used to have raised markings.  That might be the Galactic Common mark for the number five but I can't be sure.  I don't recognize the others."</p>

<p>"So it's very old?"</p>

<p>"I doubt the disc got its markings worn off <em>after</em> being mounted in platinum and surrounded by sapphires, so it was probably very old when this medallion was made.  Really hard to say about the rest of it, none of these materials is prone to decay."</p>

<p>Of course I also used my implant to probe the galactic coordinates that had been saved with the medallion, but there was nothing there; they were at least fifty thousand years old and any solar system that had been there would now be thirty or forty light-years away.  Without more information about the world and its velocity vector that would mean searching a volume of space that could contain dozens of stars.</p>

<p>An implant wasn't up to that task.  I would need special instrumentation, and probably a ship.</p>

<p>So I had two mysteries, and in both cases my best hope for making any progress would probably be found on Earth.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Well whoever made this had the same math for faceting stones that we do, but it doesn't strike me as a human construction," the gemsmith said after a lengthy examination.  "Of all the metals we use platinum is one of the hardest to work with, although also the most durable once you successfully make a piece.  Some of the styling doesn't resemble anything I've ever seen in Earth's artistic history."</p>

<p>"Any idea of their significance?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.  "Obviously not a very aesthetic combination by human standards.  The star cabochon is a bit jarring among all these faceted pieces, but of course that's how you cut a star sapphire to see the star.  It's as if the colors and sizes were chosen to tell a story.  But I have some familiarity with human traditions in that vein and this doesn't make any sense to me."</p>

<p>She was equally unhelpful about the central ceramic disc, although she agreed it was very old and worn and had probably been that way when it was mounted.</p>

<p>She wanted to send pictures to some of her colleagues but I didn't want that and instead hand carried it with a written introduction from her.</p>

<p>On my fourth visit on my third continent the jeweler's son interrupted us.  When he saw the medallion he instantly said, "Who made the stellar evolution pendant?"</p>

<p>"Stellar evolution?" his father asked.</p>

<p>"Sure.  Starts out black, but ha-ha with a star, then the cloud collapses and ignites so it starts shining and gets brighter and brighter yellow as you go around clockwise until this orange thing, that might be when helium fusion starts, then it turns into a red giant and finally blammo goes nova."</p>

<hr />

<p>The head of the astronomy department at the University of Melbourne agreed.  "These are actually very carefully sized and selected for their color," he said.  "If this were the life of our own Sun, these stones would represent time intervals of about six hundred million years with great verisimilitude."</p>

<p>"But it could be another star," I said.</p>

<p>"Pretty much any star the Curators chose to develop for an indexed world.  Our Sun isn't the most common type of star in the galaxy -- those would be red dwarves -- but it is the kind of star around which all Curated worlds are found.  It's the kind of star they favor, possibly because their own original homeworld circled one."</p>

<hr />

<p>The jewelers had been making me aware that the object I was showing around was almost literally priceless, and that while nobody kept high station in their occupation by practicing theft there were people afoot who would go to a lot of effort to take such a thing for themselves.  I kind of had a sense of that which is why I was avoiding electronic communications, but after a couple of weeks on Earth I must have showed it off one time too many because I found myself being grabbed from behind and stuffed into the trunk of an aircar.</p>

<p>I had the pendant in a padded bag strapped to my torso under my clothes.  It was designed to be pickpocket proof and was reinforced with composite wires.  My captors didn't bother trying to relieve me of it until they got me to some kind of large private indoor place where they could interrogate me.  They were a man and a woman, and while the man was dressed ordinarily for one of the professional classes the woman was wearing a leather coat and dark shades that hid her eyes.  I sensed instinctively that she was the dangerous one.</p>

<p>"We need to see your jewelry item," the man said.</p>

<p>"I need to know you're not going to take it," I said.</p>

<p>"If we were planning to do that we would have already killed you," the woman said.</p>

<p>"But what if I don't have it on me?"</p>

<p>"It's in that security bag strapped to your body.  You haven't done badly for an amateur," she said.  "But we're not amateurs."</p>

<p>I went through the elaborate process of releasing and opening the bag and handed the man the necklace.  "You have no idea what this is," he said.</p>

<p>"That's what I've been trying to find out."</p>

<p>"Why?  So you know how much to ask for it when you fence it?" the woman said sharply.</p>

<p>"No!  There was a note with the key that led me to it that said it should be returned to its proper owner.  That's what I've been trying to do.  There were also coordinates, but they're fifty thousand years old..."</p>

<p>"Recite them," the man said.</p>

<p>I did.  He semed to deflate a bit.  "I think he's genuine," he said to the woman.</p>

<p>"Well it's your rodeo," she said back to him.</p>

<p>After I told them my story the woman left in the aircar and the man watched as I stowed the pendant and reassembled my clothes.</p>

<p>When I was ready he held out his hand.  When I accepted his grasp the dingy warehouse interior turned to stark daylight, and I realized we were at the entrance to the Gateway shuttle terminal, nearly seven thousand kilometers from where we had been a moment before.</p>

<p>"I thought there was an inhibitor," I said dumbfounded as we started to walk toward it.</p>

<p>"There is," he said.  "But I have an amplifier which can punch through it for a short distance."</p>

<p>"How short a distance?"</p>

<p>"For what we need to do next, too short," he said.  And with that we reached the ticket counter.</p>

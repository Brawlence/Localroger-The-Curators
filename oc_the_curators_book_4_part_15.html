<p><em>Eight Months Later</em></p>

<p>I didn't really have business in Atlanta, so I filled my time taking in the sights and keeping abreast of galactic politics as I waited for Helen to complete her training.  I met with Jay occasionally and directly exchanged several messages with Emma via the shuttle crew confirming my status.  One evening I got a polite microfold request for connection from Helen.  She was ready to leave Earth.</p>

<p>I met her at the Gateway shuttle groundpad and we boarded together.  We had drinks at the bar and watched the sky darken as the shuttle took off.  I tried to ask her several times what had happened and she shrugged me off.  "The proper time will come," she said, which was a much more Veronica thing for her to say than anything I'd ever heard her say before.</p>

<p>At Gateway we made our way to the Curator lounge, and had another drink.  Then she said, "I'm not going back to the Pinwheel.  I have this for you."  And she held up her hand.</p>

<p>I received a burst transmission that I could tell represented many hours of memories, and then she disappeared.  I could have followed her, but if she had been trained by Veronica she probably knew how to shake off a fold pursuer.  I made safe the transmission she had sent me and boarded the Galaxy Shuttle to the Pinwheel.</p>

<p>In my stateroom as the shuttle began its fold journey to the Pinwheel I began to review her message.</p>

<hr />

<p>"I will teach you the basics of fighting, but most of what I know is specific to human enemies.  You will need to know the anatomical weaknesses of your opponent in order to prevail most efficiently.  Fortunately your implant will make it easy for you to learn to aim and strike at whatever point you decide to attack with maximum power and speed."</p>

<p>Veronica and Helen faced each other.  Veronica adopted the ready stance and Helen followed.  "Strike me," Veronica said, and Helen moved.  Veronica warded her off but not easily.  They faced off again.  "It takes human students hundreds of attempts to master that attack," Veronica said.  "It took Andrew five.  It will take you three."  Helen lunged again, and this time Veronica only barely got away.  Helen's third attempt ended with Veronica on the floor and Helen poised to strike her neck.</p>

<p>"This is just practice, but you just made what would be a mistake in a real fight," Veronica said.  "Particularly in our vocation."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"You stopped.  When you do this against a real opponent, you must follow through and kill them, because if you don't they will kill you."</p>

<hr />

<p>They shared tea around a campfire in some wild place.  They had been practicing wilderness navigation and tracking techniques.  "You need to decide soon exactly what it is you want," Veronica said.</p>

<p>"I want to find the people who tried to destroy the human worlds."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because destroying worlds is not an appropriate way to conduct yourself."</p>

<p>"But why these people?  Is it because they threatened humans specifically?"</p>

<p>"Of course not.  Neither my bioform nor my Ancestor were human.  Destroying a world that is populated by a civilization of sentient beings is a very evil thing to do and they must be stopped."</p>

<p>"And how do you plan to stop them?"</p>

<p>Helen looked down into her cup of tea.  "I will kill them all," she said.</p>

<hr />

<p>"It is a great secret not known to most of the Curators here on Earth that it is actually possible to fold a short distance through our inhibitor field."  Veronica pointed out a shed about fifty meters away.  "See if you can make it there.  You will have to override a lot of alarms and adjust feedback parameters as your implant tries to make the target, but it should be possible."</p>

<p>Helen tried and failed, tried and failed again, and then her memory went dark until she opened the door of the shed.  She concentrated and with more confidence folded back to within a couple of meters of Veronica.</p>

<p>"That could save your life one day.  It once saved Jay and Emma."</p>

<hr />

<p>"Two blocks from here is a bar which is a favored gathering place for exile Curators.  Go mingle and try to get a feel for interacting with them.  Remember that you are much older than you really are, but fortunately it is normal here for a Curator to be vague about her specific experiences.  Don't be confrontational or too forward about possibly controversial topics.  You need to learn to create rapport so that they will share information with you."</p>

<p>Helen found the bar and entered.  She asked the bartender for advice and got one of the better brands of Australian Scotch.  As she sipped her drink she looked around.  The patrons were very diverse, and there were a few humans present; Veronica had warned Helen that there would be furry chasers in these places.  Another female of a species similar to Prometheans, but with more colorful fur and a more prominent snout, approached her.</p>

<p>"New to Earth?" she said.</p>

<p>"That obvious, huh?"</p>

<p>"We've all been here for the first time, honey.  At least the bartender steered you well."  She shared a memory flash, and Helen experienced the other Curator's first experience in an Earth bar being served something that tasted a lot more like isopropyl than ethyl alcohol.</p>

<p>Helen took a sip of her drink and nodded.  "Ouch," she said in solidarity with the memory flash.  "Do they really hate us that much?"</p>

<p>"Some of them do.  But not most of them.  Earth gets under your skin.  For the first few years it will seem like the most chaotic, painful, hateful place you've ever lived, but one day you will realize that there really is no other place like it in the galaxy, and for all their flaws humans are the best hosts you could want."</p>

<p>"Why is that, do you suppose?"</p>

<p>"They weren't Curated," the other said, and Helen's ears literally pricked upward a bit.  "Nothing ever moderated them and they love and hate with equal randomness and enthusiasm.  A human can be your best friend and your worst enemy within the span of a few minutes.  And while they treat us a little differently because we're not human, they don't treat us that much differently than they treat each other."</p>

<p>"If you could safely go back to... wherever, would you?"</p>

<p>The bartender refreshed their drinks.  "Thirty, forty Earth years ago, I might have.  Now?  I wouldn't know how to live on a Curated world.  Everything so sedate and stable.  Tomorrow and today and yesterday all the same as a life ago and presumably a life from now.  Earth is a place where things happen even when nothing is happening.  For example you might meet an interesting colleague who does not have the Mark of the Curators."</p>

<p>Helen sipped her drink.  "My bioform's people cauterize the stem ganglion shortly after birth."</p>

<p>"Prometheans?  The people who invented the glass fold drives?"</p>

<p>Helen nodded.</p>

<p>"What the hell brings you here?"</p>

<p>"Humans are all over Prometheus," Helen said.  "And with them other kinds of interest.  What I'd been sent there to do was no longer a thing, and I figured if I was going to get the worm, it would probably be safer to get it here."</p>

<p>"A sensible calculus."  They clinked their glasses.  "If you find yourself in season this is a good place to make a hookup.  There are always a few humans hanging around, and the males in particular will fuck anything that has a hole their genitals can fit."</p>

<p>"I'll keep it in mind," Helen said.</p>

<p>I realized that as she conversed, Helen was also methodically scanning all the patrons.  The method she was using was not the one I'd learned from Jay.  It seemed to be related to some of the things we had learned from the rover.  She was exploring what other maintenance codes and legacy communication channels might still be open that she remembered from her experience as an Ancestral engineer.</p>

<p>And one of those channels revealed the pass code for the mainenance menu I'd used to create the fold-following worm.  Helen could tell who was infected.  And that meant she could also probably reverse the infection by bypassing the pass code and resetting the fold following function.</p>

<hr />

<p>As soon as I was in range of Terminus I contacted Emma, who told me via the microfold to not even waste time seeing her and go to the one entity who might be able to illuminate the situation.</p>

<p>At Bascule I found that the rover had become so important to some elements of its terraforming mission that I had to seriously twist some arms to get a few hours of quality time with it.  It suggested that we go camping at a site which was of interest for its current project, so I pitched a tent while it sniffed around the area.</p>

<p>"This is a highly unusual encounter," it said when I had settled in.</p>

<p>"There are big events unfolding," I said.  "Some of them have to do with maintenance codes you might remember."</p>

<p>"Oh, those," it said.  "At the point where I was in the development, management already wanted all kinds of security measures to be put in place, but the people who actually had to do the work would write the pass codes on the back of the machine with a permanent marker.  We had stuff to do."</p>

<p>"And a lot of those pass codes are the same today."</p>

<p>"So I understand."</p>

<p>"Are you aware of the Promethean Helen?"</p>

<p>"The one who has a Curator implant uploaded with my original thought matrix?  Some of my colleagues might have mentioned that when they had had a bit too much wine."</p>

<p>"She seems to know some codes."</p>

<p>"The question is, are they stll effective?"</p>

<p>"I think they are."</p>

<p>"And you are here to ask for them."</p>

<p>I blinked.  "I didn't mean for it to be quite so naked."</p>

<p>"No worries.  Having muted emotions makes it easy for me to see when bioforms are being ruled by theirs.  And you are worried.  Why?"</p>

<p>Realizing who I was talking to I just told it the whole truth.</p>

<p>"Well," it said.  "That is quite an omelet you are trying to turn back into a hatchable egg."</p>

<p>"You might be right.  But there is a whole galaxy out there that might be about to explode, and that explosion might even reach here if it's bad enough."</p>

<p>"If your friend Helen hates the Curators so much, why do you think she would use her knowledge of the sublevel one codes to cure the disease you created with the sublevel three code and scripting engine?"</p>

<p>"I don't think she wants to cure the Fold Following Worm," I said.</p>

<p>"Then what is it you <em>are</em> worried about?"</p>

<p>"She wants to <em>kill them all</em>," I said.  "And she was taught how to do that by a human, one of the best in my experience, who might not realize just how equipped Helen might be to fulfill her quest, or just how motivated to do it completely."</p>

<p>"Yes, this is a problem," the rover said.  We hadn't said a single spoken word; we were conversing over the high band radio link.  "Even with the moderation edits I can understand how powerfully motivated I might have been by such a revelation.  You say her thought matrix is mostly mine, before the edits for this vocation?"</p>

<p>"We think about seventy percent," I said.</p>

<p>"Then yes, I agree she will probably do anything in her power to kill everyone she thinks had anything to do with the destruction of our homeworld.  Of course nobody alive today could have directly had anything to do with that, but we could be as irrational in our ways as humans sometimes are in yours.  She will find a target for her blame and annihilate them."</p>

<p>"That could really become a big problem," I said.</p>

<p>"I understand."  The rover beamed me a simple text file.  "Those are all the access codes I know.  She almost certainly knows all of them too.  There are notes in there as to what those control blocks can do.  Bear in mind that she isn't just reading them now, she remembers <em>writing</em> them."</p>

<p>"Thank you," I said.  And because there was no reason not to, I went to sleep as the sleepless rover kept patrol doing its mineralogical survey, so we could say we had made a night of it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Before I dared seek out Helen I had to make sure she could not do to me what I had done to everyone else.  Helen could easily compromise the changed password I'd used to inoculate myself from my own worm.  And for several levels further down, even to a level which could not directly support emulation of consciousness, the story seemed to be the same; there was security, but there were also back door codes put in by the people who had to keep a fast-moving project on schedule if something went wrong.  At the lowest level there was a pass code which simply couldn't be changed, and if you knew it it provided access to everything.  Someone who knew it could simply take your implant without warning if they were in microfold communication range, which basically meant anywhere in the galaxy.</p>

<p>I spent weeks in a hotel room on Terminus tracing the functionality of my own implant.  I proceeded very carefully because the functions I was probing were so dangerous.  The lowest level master password seemed to be hard-coded, so its value would be found enmeshed in procedural instructions rather than expressed openly in some readable memory element.  Implant code is not designed to be read; you can read it, but its just a bunch of numbers and figuring out what it is supposed to do is incredibly cryptic.  I thought of just blocking all execution of the code block that implemented the password, but it turned out to part of a heartbeat process that had to go billions of times per second for higher level functions to work properly.</p>

<p>The original engineers really wanted that access in case they needed it.  They made sure that if you tried to eliminate their access, it fucked up your shit in other completely unrelated ways.</p>

<p>After a few months I returned to Bascule to have another talk with the rover.</p>

<hr />

<p>It gave a digital chuckle as I described what I wanted to do.  "Well of course we wouldn't have wanted you to do that," it said.  "A week later you'd come to us asking to fix something we no longer had access to."</p>

<p>"I understand how that works," I said.  "The situation is a bit different nowadays."</p>

<p>"Of course."  It had a new tool built by the human colonists which it was carrying a few centimeters at a time, planting on the ground, and sampling.  Over and over as we talked.</p>

<p>"I think I know where it is in the code, but I don't dare change it because if I fuck it up..."</p>

<p>"No more implant.  Of course.  Now I understand why you are here.  The code change you need is very simple.  There is a function which is executed when there is a pass code attempt, and that function is compromised with the master backdoor password.  But within that function is a test to see whether the provided value is the master backdoor, and if it is there is what your programmers call an execution branch.  All that is necessary is to overrite that branch with a dead instruction.  I believe you call this a No-Op."</p>

<p>"Yes.  But if I screw it up..."</p>

<p>"Of course, no more implant.  I can do this and make sure it is correct.  I helped to write these functions.  You will need to activate the pass code for legacy radio access, I believe I can patch that to the lower-level functions."</p>

<p>For one moment I felt a wave of pure terror.  I had to give this machine my complete trust to do this thing.  It could do anything to me and I would be completely defenceless.  For a moment I flashed back to my infant self, mauled by the big cat, dying as my people left me before the Curators came to make me one of their own.</p>

<p>"Okay, do it," I said.</p>

<p>"Done," it responded almost instantly.  "You've probably tried the code, try it now."</p>

<p>I did.  "Nothing."</p>

<p>"Of course, I had to <em>use</em> that code to get access to make the change that I did.  So I'm locked out myself now."</p>

<p>"That's what I need, since Helen is you.  Is there any chance she has done the same operation to herself?"</p>

<p>"Normally I'd say she would need the help of someone like myself.  But I suspect my full biological forebear would have been confident enough to do the surgery itself.  Helen does after all have my memories of actually creating all this functionality.</p>

<p>"Great.  So we're evenly matched."</p>

<p>"Yes.  And that's as much as you can expect in this case.  As for the rest of the Curators...  If she wants to, she can readily kill them all."</p>

<p><em>Ten Years Later</em></p>

<p><em>Promethean Uplift Project +22</em></p>

<p>The aircar came down exactly on schedule; the Prometheans didn't have a lot of things humans might take for granted, but they did have atomic clocks and while drivers of their six aircars sometimes had to land and take manual sextant readings, they had an onboard computer with superbly good timekeeping to convert their readings into accurate longitude when they did.</p>

<p>We boarded to see if we could help them offload their cargo.  They were methodically working their way into space, and even though they didn't have a drive capable of reaching space yet they knew that they would have to figure out how to deal with the environmental and navigation challenges when they got there.  We were helping them with that by using the <em>Plausible Deniability</em> to lift their experiments into space.</p>

<p>This one was a glass sphere over a meter in diameter.  "We're not going to be able to get it into the ship," M said as soon as she saw it, "and it's not fitted for the outside clamp."</p>

<p>"We are prepared.  We have brought a belt."  And indeed they had, a sewn leather waist belt for the <em>Plausible</em> that would snug the experiment's mounting flange to the top of our fuselage.  They showed us the wireless communicator and magnetic releases they would use to start and release it from inside the ship.  While the communicator closely resembled the low powered transceivers they still used for their civilization-wide radio network, it was of a new variety exploiting what the Prometheans called "non-propagation frequencies."  Or as we call them VHF, UHF, and microwaves.  They had done some automation but still relied on Morse and similar codes for almost everything, and had nothing resembling a public broadcast infrastructure.</p>

<p>"Once you release it, how do we get it back?"</p>

<p>"We don't plan to.  We'd like you to put it in orbit, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>The glass sphere was stuffed with glass plate integrated circuits, gas discharge tubes, and batteries.  Their preferred method of making semiconductors turned out to be surprisingly good for working with high voltages, and while they had shown little patience for the advanced toxic chemistry necessary for quality light emitting diodes or the precision automation necessary to make liquid crystal displays, they were masters of glasswork.  Their general illumination was by white carbon dioxide gas discharge tubes, and their instrument and computer displays were based on gas discharge Nixie tubes.  They had a few advanced computers operating cathode ray tube displays but those were exotic rarities used for research.</p>

<p>They called up a bunch of numbers on the flyer's Nixie display and one of the researchers told M, "These are the orbital elements we would like to reach, in your units, if possible."  Of course it was possible; M took a picture of the display with her cell phone, a device that couldn't make phone calls out in the galactic boonies but which still could make itself useful.</p>

<p>"Without any external navigation aids, even with our technology all I'm going to be able to manage is an approximation of this orbit."</p>

<p>"That's fine.  Part of this project is a civilization-wide project to receive data and make observations to establish a ground relationship to an object in space."</p>

<p>"How are you going to make ground observations of something this small when it's four hundred kilometers up?"</p>

<p>He pointed out a large gas tube inside the sphere and said, "Xenon."  We had never seen them demonstrate a flash tube, but they hadn't needed one until now.</p>

<p>The Prometheans took care of mounting the belt around our spaceship and then securing the experimental sphere.  They were extremely careful and we didn't really worry about them; they all regarded the <em>Plausible</em> as something like a sacred object.  After some final tests they announced we were ready to fly.  Four technicians would fly with us.</p>

<p>"How is it powered?" M asked as we lifted off.</p>

<p>"Lithium-air battery with solar recharge."</p>

<p>"Solar cells that small won't be able to keep up with much use."</p>

<p>"We expect it to function intermittently.  Measuring that performance is one of our test goals, since this technology may be powering conveyance and life support for us one day."</p>

<p>M took us up slowly so as not to stress the leather mounting belt.  "Won't a lithium-air battery cause some pretty wild pressure fluctuations inside the sphere?"</p>

<p>"We expect that.  The sphere is hermetically sealed and we expect it to maintain integrity and contain the battery's oxygen.  A practical supergravity fold ship won't ever need to be in space for more than a few days so this is a test of extremes."</p>

<p>Once we cleared the atmosphere M folded to a good starting point for their desired orbit and accelerated to orbital velocity.  "This is the best I can do at making your orbital specification," M said.  "It should be within a few percent."</p>

<p>"That is fine.  We will figure out how close it is from ground observations if all goes well."  She sent a message from the communicator and their was a faint pop as the satellite was released.  M maneuvered the ship so that we could see it through the forward viewing hemisphere.</p>

<p>"Almost beyond visibility already," I said, and as if on cue the satellite's Xenon strobe went off temporarily blinding all of us.</p>

<p>"We made it very bright."</p>

<p>After a few final consultations with their communicator the research team said there was no reason to stay with it any longer, so M took us back to our lab.  Once we landed the research team got on their flyer and went back to the lab that had built the sphere, taking their leather launch belt with them.  "We're not sure we'll ever need it again, but if we do we'll have it," the team leader said as they closed up the levitation flyer and lifted off.</p>

<p>Four days later their was a knock on our door shortly before sunset.  It was the Promethean director of our lab.  "I know you've seen it a lot closer, but I thought you might want to join us for the first flyover," he said.  "It's a big deal for us.  Once the battery wears we won't be so sure the flasher is working on any particular pass."</p>

<p>There were nearly two hundred Prometheans gathered on the street, which had been closed to traffic.  When we appeared there was a little cheer but everyone went back to rubbernecking the sky.  There were at least six sextants mounted on tripods.  Fortunately we had a perfectly clear sky with no clouds.</p>

<p>When the first blink happened, about thirty degrees above the horizon, there was a cheer.  The sextant operators got busy.  The trick for them was to track and anticipate the sky motion so as to get at least one accurate sighting.  The radio network was propagating a standard time signal for them to use.  For the rest of us it was a light display as the satellite crossed the sky, blinking about once every ten seconds.  And we understood other researchers were on radios, recording data about temperature, battery performance, and other factors.  The sphere had several transmitters operating on different frequencies.</p>

<p>We were surprised to find that one of the sextant operators in front of our lab was one of the researchers who had flown it into orbit with us.  We waited for her to complete her observations and said hello.</p>

<p>"We thought you went back to base," we said once she had written down her readings.</p>

<p>"Oh I did, but we are keeping all six aircars busy during these first orbits so as to get as many quality observations as possible from our largest settlements."</p>

<p>"I was wondering about this," M said.  "What's the point of all the amateur observations?  You only need a few professional observations to pin down the orbit."</p>

<p>"That is true, but not our real objective.  You do recall that once we built our first aircar we began taking aerial photographs of our settlements to record them.  We printed an atlas of our results three years ago."</p>

<p>"I do recall the atlas coming out.  Our lab has a copy," I said.</p>

<p>"Well our photography skills are still primitive since we didn't see much use for it until this project, so it wasn't practical for us to photograph our entire domain.  So while we now have accurate maps of all our settlements, our estimates of exactly where those settlements are are sometimes off by tens of kilometers.  Since the satellite moves very fast, and everyone can receive our atomic time broadcasts, even poor observations can locate the observer to within a few meters.  We will be processing the data from these first days for some time but we expect it to greatly improve the accuracy of our maps."</p>

<p>M and I faded back to our quarters before anyone else might realize our role in the spectacle.  You could say the hard part was getting it into orbit and we had done that for them, but really the important part was that it was Promethean technology functioning in space, a real and perceptible thing in which their entire society was participating.</p>

<p>They would be getting around to the getting it into space themselves part soon enough.</p>

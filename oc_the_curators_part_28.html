<p>The President of the Witnesses looked exactly as she had forty years previously.  M and I did not -- we looked very noticeably younger and healthier, despite our advanced age.  And this was a problem because the boost serum they had given humanity doesn't reverse most of the hazards of already being old, it only slows down further aging.</p>

<p>We were naked and in body paint so as to hide our identity on our travels.  "Welcome back," the President said.  "We expected to see you again, but not quite so soon.  I realize this is not how you would choose to present yourselves to others.  We have quarters and clothing for you if you would like to adjust your appearance."</p>

<p>"That would be nice," M said.</p>

<p>In our private room clothes were laid out for us upon a much more Earthlike bed than we had been assigned on our first visit.  After washing off the body paint we looked at the clothes and M said, "these appear to be just like the outfits we were wearing on our last visit."</p>

<p>"Not duplicates though," I pointed out.  "More like reproductions.  They are made with natural fibers, I don't think you can do that with nanites."</p>

<p>When we returned to the conference room there was a buffet of very convincing Earthlike food.  We nibbled and sat with the leaders of the Witnesses and the feathered Curator who had brought us to them.  "To begin we owe you an apology," the President said.  "We could not resist the temptation to test our biological understanding on beings who do not have any of the thirty-five known genetic triggers that create the Mark of the Curator in various species."</p>

<p>"You made us immortal?" I asked.</p>

<p>"None of us is immortal," she said.  "We don't age and we heal very well.  You will find that you can last a very long time without oxygen and you will regenerate limbs and nerve damage that you couldn't before.  But enough trauma done quickly enough, particularly to the brain, will kill any of us."</p>

<p>"Barring that, how long can we expect to live?" M asked.</p>

<p>"We honestly can't say.  The boost, which we give to any species that asks for it, is generic to your individual members once we tailor it to your species.  It mostly corrects things that are easy to correct, but which evolution doesn't bother to.  The Cure, which provides for longer life, is much more individually specific.  On the long term there are thousands of more subtle equilibria which must be stabilized and sources of damage to repair.  We would have advised you to return in forty or fifty thousand years for a checkup, after which we could give you a clearer longer-term picture.  With such a checkup I think we could guarantee several hundred thousand years, and depending on certain tests would more likely suggest between two and three million as a likely target.  Further checkups might extend even that."</p>

<p>"I don't think we have any idea how to thank you," I said.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't thank us.  We did it to you without warning and we know it isn't unheard of for those who haven't received our gifts to capture and dissect those who have to try unlocking our secrets.  We did it because you are the only living beings who have ever seen a planet folded into its star, and because each of you has also accomplished something famous, victory in rare foldship battle and brokering the most unlikely peace accord the Galaxy has seen in aeons.  Our motives were selfish and we should have at least told you what we were doing."</p>

<p>"Do the people who dissect your beneficiaries ever get what they are looking for?"</p>

<p>"No, which is the most annoying thing about that.  As with your fold drives, there really isn't any secret to the Cure, except a long period of learning and building specialized machinery and a lot of hard work which must be executed perfectly to make use of that knowledge.  The cellular mechanisms we inserted into your bodies are tuned for your individual genotypes and any one of them will only work for a small fraction of other beings, even of your own species.  Our library of such tweaks and our understanding of how to deploy them is vast though.  We were mildly suprised not to find any surprises in your genome related to your lack of the Mark."</p>

<p>"These clothes seem to be replicas of what we wore on our last visit," M said.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes.  So they are.  It is our mission to witness what we can, so we examined your clothing while we were working on your bodies, and found it a fascinating source of mystery.  Your clothes were made of a mix of natural and synthetic fibers assembled somehow to be much tougher and more durable than anything we could make for ourselves, if we needed such material.  We sought to learn your techniques for reference."  She dialed a code on a touchpad, and had a brief conversation in a very nonhuman language.  "Let me introduce you to our fabric researcher."</p>

<p>We took a brief ride on a hover scooter through palace halls and courtyards and came to a large room filled with fabric samples.  A male Witness approached and said, in less natural but perfectly understandable English, "Welcome to the textile lab."</p>

<p>We bowed.  "Are these samples from all over the galaxy?"  M asked.</p>

<p>"No.  These are all from Earth.  No other world makes fabric such as humans do."  He led us past rows of samples of silk, cotton, synthetics, and blends to a loom.  "Even with your open historical records, it took us five years to build a machine which could theoretically do industrial production of cloth such as you were doing four hundred Earth years ago, before you even had electricity.  Nanites are remarkably unhelpful in building a loom."</p>

<p>"Why do you take such interest in this?" M asked.</p>

<p>"We think it made you what you are.  Everybody is so impressed with your fold drives -- and make no mistake, they are impressive -- that they lose the thread of where your ability to make such things came from.  And we find in your modesty habit and your insatiable need for cloth the thing that drove your first quest to make a really complex machine despite your lack of nanite technology.  Some speak of your aggressiveness and talent for war, but you were still making weapons by handicraft when you were making textiles by industrial techniques.  It would be over a hundred years into your industrial revolution before you learned to make firearms as well as you could make cloth."</p>

<p>While we were thinking of that a loudspeaker broadcast something in what we had come to assume was the Witnesses' own language.  "We should go back to the conference room," the President said.  "Your pursuers have found you."</p>

<p>"We have come from Earth to recover two human fugitives.  We have reason to believe they might have come to this world.  We have the ability to land on any small flat place, please advise."</p>

<p>The President looked at us, and pressed a touch button.  "Why do you seek these fugitives," she asked.</p>

<p>"They are dangerous.  Their presence on your world places you in great jeopardy."</p>

<p>"For reference, this is a smile," she said to us, flashing what we as humans would call something like a grimace.  Then she hit the touchpad.  "Landing directions are forthcoming."  She touched another point.  "Guide the Earth ship to our north courtyard, then make sure they can't leave."</p>

<p>"They are the violent ones," M said.</p>

<p>"We know."</p>

<p>Half an hour later the other humans stomped into the room, carrying J20 combat firearms.  "So nice of you to hold them for us," their leader said with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Oh we didn't hold them for you.  We used them as bait."</p>

<p>M and I looked at one another.</p>

<p>The other humans raised their rifles but stopped half-way and collapsed twitching.  "Your real reason for coming here is that you want our technology.  Too bad that technology makes it so simple to synthesize a paralytic to target your genome," the President said.</p>

<p>"Wait, if your paralytic targets humans, why are we still upright?" M asked.</p>

<p>"Well, one of the other things we neglected to warn you about is that after the Cure, you aren't <em>exactly</em> human any more.  There are some who feel that the Cure destroys the individual, changing them into a new and alien being.  It does make you sterile by design, but you had already forgone reproduction within your natural window for that."</p>

<p>"But you did it to us even though some people feel that way about it?"</p>

<p>"Those people are idiots, and you didn't strike us as being that stupid."  She gestured toward our now fully immobile pursuers.  "Put these lot to sleep and process them.  M, you are familiar with Earth technology, would you do us the favor of giving their ship a look-over?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure," she said.</p>

<p>By the time we visited Hyacinth and received an astonishing proposal from then-Prince Henry, the outline of an economic structure between Earth and the rest of the galaxy was beginning to become visible.</p>

<p>At the heart of this was the ultimate secret of gravity and repulsor plating.  When we learned how to make these incredibly useful platings, we learned that by far the best and most effective way to make them was -- with nanites.  We could make plating with the techniques we used to make the fold and supergravity drives, but it didn't work any better and was more fragile and vastly more expensive.</p>

<p>Our leaders were still reluctant to delve into primary nanite manufacturing, both because of the danger of someone building a primitive and detunable nanite fold drive and because it was the lack of nanite tech that had forced us to explore other methods and develop our other unique capabilities.  So we wrote up specifications and a catalog of possibly useful stuff we could provide that you couldn't easily make with nanites, and published them on the microfold network.</p>

<p>We had an insatiable appetite for repulsor plating because this was the motive force behind flying transport vehicles.  It was strong enough to lift one of our small aircraft style starships, but not anything much heavier.  It wasn't adequate for velocity adjustment after folding between regions of the galaxy.  But it could power a flying car from a pack of AA batteries.  And it was within the means of any interested alien community to follow our specifications for the tile types we wanted and make a steady supply of the stuff with sunlight for power and local minerals for raw materials.</p>

<p>In return we supplied commodity machines and tools; bearings, drill bits, extruded and threaded rods, nuts and bolts were all popular.  It soon became common to find hybrid designs published on the microfold that were mostly made of nanites but also requiring precision parts from Earth.  It didn't hurt that we could easily make delivery and take our trade items at the surface of other worlds.  We offered discounts to worlds that could provide landing strips because we still had a lot more converted aircraft than <em>Trinity</em> style second generation ships, but we were building those as fast as we could.</p>

<p>The Bank of Earth was off to a solid start if only because the Earth industries that supplied our end of the trade wanted to be paid in money.  And while it was new to them, the aliens who made a regular practice of dealing with us quickly realized that having funds in our bank gave them great flexibility when they were making wish lists from our catalog of available goods.</p>

<p>This was the situation when we brought the Hyacinth Regent of Technology Development to Reagan National Airport in the <em>Horse Pill</em>.  He returned to Earth with us to give his presentation to a group of dignitaries and specialists for evaluation.</p>

<p>"Do we have some time before the meeting?" he asked as we landed.  The Regent spoke excellent English as his Prince did, and instructed us to call him by the human name John.</p>

<p>"Yes, we were generous with the scheduling."</p>

<p>"If it's possible I would like to make a quick visit to your national zoo.  I understand there is an underground transport that can take us there."</p>

<p>Fortunately it had become common enough for aliens to be seen on the streets of human cities, particularly capitals like Washington, that we didn't attract an unworkable amount of attention.  At the zoo John skipped all the more spectacular exhibits and guided us straight to the tropical birds, where we found ourselves facing a pair of enormous bright blue parrots.  The sign called them Hyacinth Macaws.  Just like any tourist, John took a few pictures.</p>

<p>"Your named your world after them, not the flower?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  The birds are themselves named after the flower, but these fellows are as closely related to us as anything on your world.  Their coloration is nearly identical to ours.  And while we have no flighted ancestors, like these birds our ancestors were ground-based feathered bipedal carnivores like many of your dinosaurs."</p>

<p>"And the Curators wiped out their dinosaur ancestors with an asteroid strike."</p>

<p>Regent John laughed, in his native Hyacinth way.  "Yes, Curators will do that.  Our ancestors tended to stubbornly get stuck in dead-end monster mode.  They had to wipe out our ancestors <em>three times</em> before we came along."</p>

<p>Having seen the macaws we made our way back to the zoo entrance and then the subway.  "Is there any significance to the human names you have chosen to take on?" M asked as we hiked down the hill toward the subway station.</p>

<p>"Prince Henry took the name of one of your own royalty he admires, Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal.  And for my anticipated role in our future development he suggested the name of John Frank Stevens, an engineer who is credited with making your ambitious Panama Canal project practical."</p>

<p>"Prince Henry knows an awful lot about our history," I said as we stepped onto the subway escalator.</p>

<p>"Prince Henry wants to learn from every available source.  And most of what is out there has been known by everyone for billions of years.  You humans are a fascinating exception."</p>

<p>Several hours later we were in the Oval Office.  "This is not the meeting you came here for," the President said matter-of-factly.  "But we want to know what this might mean before we present it to the rest of our world."</p>

<p>"It's a simple enough deal," John said.  "We want a supergravity drive for our prototype, in return for a copy of our prototype surface landing fold ship.  We assume you can outfit your ship with the supergravity and your own superior fold drive.  And we would like your technical assistance setting up an independent manufacturing facility on a colony world which can make more supergravity drives."</p>

<p>"Before we could get any use out of this enormous ship we would have an incredibly difficult job outfitting it," one of the men in attendance said.</p>

<p>"How is that?" Regent John asked.</p>

<p>"This thing must have a hundred square kilometers of deck.  It will need appointments, furniture, plumbing, lighting, and a thousand more details to make it useful.  It would suck up a generation's resources and I'm not sure what we would do with it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think you understand," the Regent said.  "All those things are included.  They are built-in by the nanite construction team.  These ships have been made for aeons, and their construction has long been a well honed art.  Despite the unique utility of being able to land, which will call for a few adjustments, most of the things you mention are long ago solved problems.  We will deliver you a ship that is ready to board and fly once its drives are installed and calibrated."</p>

<p>"But what about toilets, food production and distribution..."</p>

<p>"Of course.  Galaxy wide there are about twenty most common types of body form for hospitality purposes, differing in things like furniture size, bedding preferences, food supply and preparation and waste removal.  Our usual practice is to outfit about half the ship as staterooms and the rest as functional gathering and work areas of different sizes, and to outfit about half the staterooms and work areas for the species that runs the ship with the others a varied mix.  We have also studied your designs for things like toilets and sinks to tweak them to your preferred style.  With nanites it's just a software problem."</p>

<p>"It would take a huge crew," the man said.</p>

<p>"It would, if you choose to use it that way.  Most foldships have a large live-on crew.  Then again, I understand most of your large seagoing vessels do too, and they can't fly between the stars."</p>

<p>The President spoke up.  "Regent, would you like a tour of our historic White House?  I need to have a word with my people."</p>

<p>"Of course.  Do you allow photographs?  My Prince will be fascinated."</p>

<p>"In most areas we do, the guide will let you know."  He slapped the intercom and said "Theresa, we have an alien with the most beautiful blue feathers you've ever seen who needs a tour of our house."</p>

<p>After Regent John left the President eyed the man who had spoken up.  "M and J, I don't think you've met my Secretary of Defense," he said.</p>

<p>"Actually I have sir," M said.  "He gave me a medal once."</p>

<p>"What is your problem, H?" the President asked him.</p>

<p>"This is an enormous and unexpected undertaking," he said.  "We have no budget for it, no schedule, no personnel, and it promises to dwarf important existing programs."</p>

<p>"H, stop thinking about blowing shit up for a change and think about what this means.  Within the next twenty years they are telling me about five billion people are going to lose their homes due to sea level rise.  They will need to go somewhere, but most of the somewhere they could go here on Earth is already occupied by other people who aren't going to want them.  They will need to eat, and at least half our arable land is also going to go under or become desert.  Maybe more.  The very manufacturing facilities that our blue friend is so interested in are going to be flooded and destroyed by storms with ever increasing frequency.  Have I left anything out?  Am I blowing it out of proportion?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," he said quietly.</p>

<p>"This ship, this <em>one ship</em> could save our damn bacon.  We have the colony worlds.  The aliens have wondered why we planted flags on so many of them, that was thinking ahead.  But we also have to get the people there and more importantly the infrastructure and industries to support them.  It's been happening but it's <em>too slow</em>.  M and J, would you say one of these ships could transport an entire city all at once, its buildings on those skirt decks and its population in the staterooms?"</p>

<p>"I'd say that's exactly what it's designed to do," M said.</p>

<p>"And Prince Henry is an avid student of our species," I added.  "He may have anticipated this need and constructed an offer he knew we would be foolish to refuse."</p>

<p>"And we won't," the President said with finality.  "We'll let Regent John present his offer, but the only question will be whether we tell them to paint a UN flag on the hull or a US flag.  One way or the other we're giving them their damn gravity drive and we're <em>gratefully</em> taking the ship."</p>

<p>The next day the Regent made his case to the United Nations general assembly, and the President followed with his own.  The vote wasn't even close; the ship would have a UN flag, and the deal would set a myriad of smaller preparatory plans in motion all across the Earth.</p>

<p>As we walked onstage a thunderous roar filled the studio.  The audience were stomping the floor with their naturally hard soled feet, and the floor was wood so it made quite a racket.  In fact, I realized that the entire building seemed to be made of wood, as were many of the other Kattegatian structures we had seen on our tour.  Being used to our extensive use of wood on Earth I had failed to notice how sharply this contrasted with both Seville and Pompeii, where almost everything was made of nanite matrices.</p>

<p>"We have a very unusual show today," the host said with a flourish that could have been taken directly from Earth late night TV.  "Our guests tonight are aliens who crossed the entire galaxy to find us, despite having never ventured more than a few hundred light-years from their home world before.  Our guests have only had the fold drive for a few years, and space travel of any kind for only a few generations.  Almost within living memory they did not have electric power or powered transport, yet today they cross the galaxy in craft they build themselves."</p>

<p>There was polite stomping.</p>

<p>"There are a couple of other things you need to know about our guests, who call themselves humans and their world Earth.  As you can see from the female who graciously offered to wear and display colors for us, they have no Mark of the Curators.  Although the Earth itself was apparently Curated, being typical of a world shaped to host life, the ancestors of humans themselves haven't been Curated for some time.  They have achieved all of their accomplishments without any of the usual help -- no gifts of fire or agriculture or writing or steam power or electric theory, and no nanites.  They had to build it all themselves."</p>

<p>This elicited a different reaction from the audience, a collective gasp of surprise.</p>

<p>"I know what you're thinking.  Nobody has ever heard of an uncurated species with language or civilization much less space travel before.  Well, we have now.  Our first encounter with humans was with these two individuals, our present day guests.  This was their fold ship."  On the monitors we saw the broadcast image change to a picture of the <em>Grasshopper</em> in space.  The fold ship we destroyed must have gotten it to them in the last moments before its destruction.</p>

<p>Another audience gasp.  "Kattegatians, this is the human fold ship <em>Small Hopping Insect.</em>"</p>

<p>This time the audience reaction was different still.  It was bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Human J, you named this craft didn't you?  Would you care to tell us the significance?"</p>

<p>"Certainly.  Thank you for your welcome, by the way.  <em>Grasshopper</em> is capable of taking off from the surface of a world, flying high enough on its air breathing engines to fold safely away, and dropping into the atmosphere and landing with its air-breathing engines on another world.  It doesn't need surface infrastructure to do any of this."</p>

<p>At this the audience started stomping.  This was something anyone in the galaxy would recognize as extraordinary.</p>

<p>"There's <em>much</em> more," the host said.  "Being raiders, when we learned the humans were building craft like this, we wanted one for ourselves for obvious reasons.  And what do we do when we want something on Kattegat?"</p>

<p>The audience enthusiastically shouted in unison, and the translator dryly said:  "We raid."</p>

<p>"And that is precisely what we did.  And you might wonder, since we crossed the galaxy to steal their technology, why M and J are sitting here in a broadcast studio instead of in a cell being interrogated as alien prisoners."</p>

<p>The audience murmured in confusion.</p>

<p>"The <em>Small Hopping Insect</em> wasn't just equipped with a fold drive.  It was <em>armed</em>.  While they were sleeping it autonomously woke them up and warned them that we were coming so they could escape our surprise attack, and when we gave chase... well, Human M, this was your triumph, was it not?  Why don't you tell us what happened next?"</p>

<p>M, who was naked in a building full of aliens, told them, "I fired on them with the sunlight cannon and fatally damaged their ship.  As they fell toward the ground, since they did not have orbital velocity, my fold drive alerted me to anomalous fold activity and I folded us out just in time to watch them fold the entire planet into its host star."</p>

<p>The audience gasped, and there were some growls of anger.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry about the loss of your ship and your people," M continued.  "But I think your own people would say that if someone comes after you, you will do whatever you have to to escape and hit back."</p>

<p>The host made a gesture toward the audience, and they began stomping in rhythmic unison.  "Humans, this is how we express respect toward those who have earned it."  The stomping turned more chaotic, like the applause we had heard earlier.</p>

<p>"And there is <em>even more</em> to this extraordinary story.  The humans took the trouble to find us, but when our guests came they did not bring their superweapon.  This is what happened."</p>

<p>On the monitors they played the tape of our initial encounter after landing, when I told them the fold ship <em>Boxcar</em> was a gift and that we wished to be allies.  This left the audience staring in dumbfounded silence.</p>

<p>"Would you care to explain why any species, much less two individuals such as yourselves, responds to an attempt to raid and kill you with such generosity?"</p>

<p>"I reasoned that if you wanted our technology so badly you must have some good reason.  There is no shortage of resources in the galaxy, but we knew from our short association with a couple of other Curated races that there is a shortage of ways to reach those resources on worlds that aren't already developed.  We came to offer you such a method so you wouldn't feel the need to try taking ours again.  We knew it would be very hard for you to duplicate our industries so we came up with something easier for you to use with your existing nanite tech."</p>

<p>"And so they did!  As we broadcast our fold ship <em>scree</em> is in stable orbit around the Earth and humans have been providing transport for our research teams for several days now.  They have generously offered us everything we need to colonize undeveloped worlds on our own, without their future assistance, and to bring resources home in whatever quantity we desire."</p>

<p>There was stomping applause but I think still a bit of puzzlement in the audience.  "Our away teams have sent us some holiday snaps," the host said, and I wondered what human had taught the translator that phrase.  "Take a look."</p>

<p>The first picture was of the Manhattan skyline.  "This is just one human city," the host said.  "Some of those buildings are over eighty levels tall.  The tallest that can safely be built with nanites are about twenty levels, and those sacrifice a lot of floor area to structural support.  There are hundreds of cities that look like this on Earth."</p>

<p>There was stomping.  "These skyscrapers are built on skeletons of pure metal."  Switch to picture of a foundry pouring liquid steel.  "Humans melt and brute-shape metal on a scale that we can barely imagine.  You might wonder where the power to do this comes from."  Switch to picture of the Hoover Dam.  "Some of it comes from works like this, which exploit water pressure from hydrological runoff."  Picture of conventional power plant.  "Most comes from these, which use fire to boil water to turn electrical generators."  Picture of solar cell field.  "But while that technology built their society it has created problems, and now much of their power comes from resources like these, directly turning sunlight into electricity..."  Picture of a windmill farm.  "...or wind.  These wind turbines are miracles in their own right, almost as tall as the sky buildings and they would be impossible to build with nanites."</p>

<p>The audience was completely silent.</p>

<p>"None of this explains their aircraft or tiny fold drives though.  This is the other end of human technological prowess."  Picture of the Boeing assembly plant with a couple of Dreamliners in the foreground.  "This place makes aircraft, which use fire to propel themselves through the atmosphere like enormous birds.  So far every human starship has been a converted aircraft."  Picture of another large industrial building.  "This place makes electronic circuit wafers."  Picture of the inside, with clean room protocols being observed.  "All dust has to be removed from the air, and the precision employed is unimaginable.  Thousands of these facilities produce billions of products per day.  We may lament our scarcity of resources, but nobody in the galaxy has ever seen industrial works like those of Earth."</p>

<p>The audience began rhythmically stomping, the sign of respect.  "After the intermission, we will get more personal with these beings who crossed the galaxy to show generosity after we tried to kill them."</p>

<p>"I didn't think you had a capitalist system," I told the host when we were off-air.  "What is the purpose of the break?"</p>

<p>"We will show what I believe your people call public service advisories.  It gives the away audience a chance to attend to personal business, and us a chance to make small corrections."  While we were off-air the colorist O was escorted onstage and seated next to us.</p>

<p>"I hope your colors are wearing well," he said to M.</p>

<p>"Just fine," she said.</p>

<p>We couldn't read the countdown but the translator alerted us that it was nearing zero.  "Welcome back," the host said.  "We are now joined by one of our most renowned artists, the fur colorist O.  Welcome back, sir."</p>

<p>"It's been awhile," O said.</p>

<p>"It's been <em>scree</em> since you retired from offering color.  I don't guess I have to ask why you came back?"</p>

<p>"It has been many generations since a colorist has had the opportunity to color an opponent who defeated us in battle.  Human M has offered me a great privilege which I humbly hope I have fulfilled."</p>

<p>"Since you colored her whole body I suppose you can verify she has no Mark of the Curators?"</p>

<p>"That is true.  And in private, her companion allowed me to examine him too.  We all know the Curators embed their mark deeply and it is hard to completely obscure.  We also have confirmation from the genetic scans they allowed at our request.  It has been millions of <em>scree</em> since the Curators touched the humans' ancestors."</p>

<p>"If I may take an aside, this privacy thing is interesting.  Human J, you wear garments to obscure your body.  Care to explain that to us?"</p>

<p>"Our modesty habit goes back to our earliest history.  On earth we actually have laws requiring the use of clothes to obscure parts of our bodies from public view."</p>

<p>"Whatever for?"</p>

<p>"Well, clothing turns out to be useful; like your fur colors it can display status or personal style, and it can also protect against the environment.  Because we wear clothing we can comfortably live in some of the most hostile environments on Earth.  And even in mild climates, our ancestors apparently found constant exposure to sexual temptation distracting."</p>

<p>"But surely that would only be a factor when you are in season?  We have a rich genre of anecdotes about what a mistake it is to trust ourselves to do anything important when we are in season."</p>

<p>M and I looked at one another and couldn't help laughing.  "How often are you folks in season?"</p>

<p>"About one month per year.  Fortunately we learned to stagger our seasons long ago using hormones so we aren't all crazy and unreliable at the same time."</p>

<p>M and I looked at one another and broke out in giggles.  "Your expressions indicate mirth," the host said.  "What's so funny?"</p>

<p>"Humans are always in season," M said.</p>

<p>Eyes went wide with astonishment throughout the studio.  "You mean that right now, the two of you, you could theoretically..."</p>

<p>"There's nothing theoretical about it."</p>

<p>"But surely you aren't fertile all the time."</p>

<p>"No, naturally females like myself are fertile a few days per month.  But males are always fertile and we are all always ready to mate even when the female isn't fertile.  Our biologists believe evolution selected this for social reasons, but it became a problem when we invented cities.  Most of our closest animal relatives are more like yourselves."</p>

<p>"This is amazing.  I wasn't given this in prep.  You built the most ambitious tech in the galaxy in just a couple of generations despite being <em>constantly distracted by sexual feelings</em>?"</p>

<p>"Well, now you know why we normally wear clothes," I said.  Some of the audience actually stomped at that.</p>

<p>"But you have agreed to be naked for us," the host said to M.  "We do understand this is rather unusual for humans."</p>

<p>"Well, it was necessary to give O a proper canvas.  And honestly, I would feel a lot less safe doing this on Earth.  Here I understand nobody is sexually distracted by my body."</p>

<p>"Not exactly nobody," I said with a small snicker.</p>

<p>"I plan to mate with <em>you</em> anyway," she said matter-of-factly.  "I don't need everyone in broadcast range getting the same idea."</p>

<p>"Wow," the host said.  "Well, colorist O, can you top that by explaining your designs?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it," O said with a rumble we had been coached to understand was their form of laughter.  "I colored M's entire body, of course, and J allowed me his head and hands according to his race's more typical modesty habit.  I started them both off the same, with the burst of light on the upper right of the face, titanium white to illustrate the ray of their Sunlight Cannon."  O motioned for M to stand up.  "Across the front of her body we have M's training.  She is quite an heroic figure, having risked her life to test machinery that might not work.  Human technology is so new that fatal failures happen with some frequency.  And on her back, the Sunlight Cannon hits our fold ship <em>scree</em>.  In its death throes it transitions to her thighs, where I placed the streak of the <em>Small Hopping Insect</em>'s last-moment escape and the bright-rimmed blackness of destruction as the world beneath them was folded into its star."</p>

<p>There was generous stomping.</p>

<p>"For J, having only his face and hands to work with, I also started with the Sunlight Cannon on his face.  But in his case his hands are green with life, representing the extraordinary human forgiveness and generosity and the new potential for our own species which our alliance may portend.  As an artist I find it very beautiful that both of these outcomes emerge from the same violent origin."</p>

<p>"Thank you, O," the host said.  "For our last segment I have a connection to our Praetor of Resources N, who has been escorting our human guests for the last few days.  Praetor N are you with us?"</p>

<p>"So I am," a voice replied.  The broadcast screens showed a still picture of N and a transcription in alien type, and M and I got voice translations in English in our earphones, as we were used to by now.</p>

<p>"Praetor, what is your impression of the humans?"</p>

<p>"Well I have only dealt directly with your guests, but I am also in touch with our away team at Earth and can say they have seen much more than you have been able to show your audience.  We are learning to melt metals, to make pressure vessels and precision bearings and a few other things we need to make small portable power stations.  They have even offered to trade with us for these finished goods until we have our own manufacturing up to speed.  So we anticipate that we will begin exploration not to raid but to colonize new worlds within a month or two."</p>

<p>At this the studio erupted in stomping which the host allowed to go on for some time.  The host and O even joined in the stomping.  M and I bowed repeatedly, which we had been coached was the polite response to such praise.</p>

<p>Finally the host gestured for quiet.  "M and J, what are your own personal plans for the future?"</p>

<p>"We had been hoping to go home with your fold ship," M said.  "But your security people had different ideas."</p>

<p>Praetor N was still on the line.  "We did not know what our reception would be like at Earth," he said.  "If we had known we would have sent you along.  But if you do want to get home soon, may I offer a proposal?  Some of us would like to try out your gift to us, the fold ship <em>Square Shipping Conveyance</em>.  Would you be willing to take some of us home with you and show us how to fly it?"</p>

<p>I deferred to M, and she bowed and said "We would be honored."</p>

<p><em>One Year Later</em></p>

<p>The starship <em>Olympic</em> departed from the passenger terminal at JFK like any other aircraft.  As a VIP I made my way to the upstairs lounge and was issued a pair of Velcro slippers.  After the converted 747 took off it climbed out over the Atlantic Ocean and at 3000 meters began a series of fold transfers designed to minimize the amount of air we were taking with us into outer space.  After about ten of these we were 100 kilometers up, and folded out to Neptune to spend three hours falling into its gravity well.  Flight attendants took over, passing out alcoholic drinks in squeeze bulbs and Velcro slippers to those passengers who needed to visit the rest rooms.  The Captain came on and announced how to view Neptune's moons Triton and Nereid and some surface storms that were visible.</p>

<p>We now had over thirty runways and a half-dozen serviceable airports on more than a dozen extrasolar worlds, and we were just starting our galactic exploration.  The new world of Pretoria had only had its airstrip for a couple of months and was still very undeveloped, although some special projects were under way that were considered a bit dangerous for a more populated world.  M was waiting for me at the edge of the tarmac, and soon I had packed my little camping bag in <em>Dragonfly</em> and we were off to an even newer and more distant world.</p>

<p>We spent several days scouting sites for cities and airports and doing a little more than just camping together.  It was all peaceful R&amp;R until M woke me up in the middle of the night.  "J, you need to go to the <em>Grasshopper</em> right now.  Don't gather anything or hesitate.  We have to get out of here."</p>

<p>I had seen M in her role as a military officer a few times and I knew better than to argue.  We had parked <em>Grasshopper</em> far enough away to avoid knocking our tent down as it took off or landed.  I was climbing into the rear seat when there was a bright flash of light and I looked back to see our tent engulfed by a fireball.</p>

<p>"What the..."</p>

<p>"Quickly!"  She was already in her seat, coping secured, and starting the engines.  As <em>Grasshopper</em> rose into the air another bomb went off between the tent and our takeoff point.</p>

<p>"Okay, why am I in the jump seat in my pajamas?"</p>

<p>"Because you don't prefer to sleep naked.  Also, <em>Grasshopper</em> monitors continuously for fold events now.  I had some alarms set.  We've never known quite what to look for but there are a few things that we knew wouldn't be normal.  There's a foldship overhead and it's not in orbit.  It's positioned right over us to act as a bomber."</p>

<p>"Did we know the aliens could do that?"</p>

<p>"We knew it was within the range of their demonstrated tech.  We gamed out how it might work if we wanted to use their tech as a weapon.  We didn't know if any of them had gone to the same trouble.  These guys can obviously aim."</p>

<p>"Well they missed the ship."</p>

<p>"J, I'm pretty sure they want to <em>steal</em> the ship.  Wouldn't do them much good if they bombed it."  She punched the fold drive and folded us straight out of the atmosphere, to a point a few hundred miles away.  Within a few seconds the giant foldship appeared distressingly close.  M folded again, and the alien ship followed appearing even closer.</p>

<p>"Well, they can track fold events.  No big surprise there."</p>

<p>"What if you fold out further?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to get too far from the planet. If they try any kind of energy or projectile weapon on us, we might have to make an unpowered re-entry."</p>

<p>"They're coming closer."</p>

<p>M used the RCS jets to nudge us away, but the foldship came after us.  It wasn't as maneuverable as we were but it had a lot more power at its disposal.  <em>Grasshopper</em>'s air breathing engines don't function in vacuum so in space it depends on the relatively small RCS rockets and batteries.</p>

<p>"Well this is something I never expected to need so soon.  You might want to close your eyes, J."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You don't have a welder's mask back there, and you don't want to be blinded."  I closed my eyes and despite that my vision was blasted with white light.  I threw an arm up to block it and it barely helped.  The light was hot and searing and ended as quickly as it had begun.  When I was able to open my eyes the alien ship was quite a bit further away, and there was a giant hole in its side.</p>

<p>"<em>What</em> in the name of the Curators was <em>that</em>?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know those nifty little communicators they use so their not so smart tablets can phone home?  They call them microfold generators.  They're not capable of passing matter, only massless particles like photons, and only across a relatively limited transfer aperture.  There's a project going on Pretoria to open one of those into the photosphere of the Sun and use the solar energy to fire a steam electric generating plant.  Much more energy dense than the aliens' methods and we have all the other tech developed.  Well, along come my people with their Mars hats on, and... wait a minute.  Fuck, they're not in orbit."</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"They're falling to the surface.  They can't stop it.  The suicidal idiots didn't give themselves orbital velocity and now if they can't fold out they're all going to die."</p>

<p>"My heart bleeds for them.  Didn't they just try to kill us?" </p>

<p>"Yes, and...this is weird.  Their fold drive still seems to still have some functionality, but it looks like <em>OH MY GOD!</em>"</p>

<p>She punched us out to well beyond the world's Moon, just in time to watch the entire planet disappear in a brief explosion of sunlight.</p>

<p><em>One year later -- Promethean Uplift Project +35</em></p>

<p>The Prometheans had created thousands of research facilities to drive their progress, ranging from little shops investigating radio techniques to sprawling complexes devoted to mass-manufacturing electronic circuit plates.  In the beginning we had made an effort to visit them all once in awhile, but it became impossible.  And some of them did not want us to visit; they didn't want us to just give them human technology.  They wanted enough hints to figure out how to do it themselves but in a way that made sense to them so that they could implement on their own.</p>

<p>The shipworks was one of those.  We had known they were planning to build it, but we did not know they had actually got to the point of building a ship.  As we approached the coordinates we were given in the <em>Plausible Deniability</em> we were puzzled to find the site dominated by a three story tall spherical greenhouse.</p>

<p>We were greeted warmly and M asked where the ship was.  This resulted in some of the coughing fits we recognized as Promethean laughter.  "Surely you couldn't miss it on your approach," one of the techs said.  "It's the tallest structure here."</p>

<p>"The <em>terrarium</em> is your ship?"</p>

<p>"One habit we have decided to adopt from your people is the naming of our spacecraft.  This first one is called the <em>Gift of Guidance.</em>  As a race that lives in small groups and values parenting and teaching, we have a neutral excuse for choosing such a name, but of course it is your guidance we specifically celebrate."</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a huge glass sphere with five glass landing fins and a boarding tube taking the place of what would have been a sixth.  It had three decks, clearly visible, all also apparently made of glass.  "It's Cinderella's spaceship," I said brightly, and M gave me a nasty look.</p>

<p>"We showed you metalworking techniques," M said.  "Why in the world would you use glass for the hull?"</p>

<p>"Our hull is twenty centimeters thick, and tempered.  We calculate that any projectile that could breach it would go through even your toughest metal hulled ships like tissue paper."</p>

<p>We boarded.  The lowest level was engineering and navigation; this is where the computers were, in a circle around the perimeter.  Since it was near the bottom of the spherical hull it was small, with a two meter wide working area between the perimeter instrumentation and the spiral staircase in the center that gave access to the upper decks.  "We have three onboard 32-bit computers for redundancy and parallelism.  Any of them can do any job, including control of the multiplex drive, the ranging radar, life support, and power distribution."</p>

<p>"How big is this thing?"</p>

<p>"The hull is twelve meters in diameter.  Lithium batteries and stores are below this engineering deck; there is a space about a meter and a half deep there.  If you look straight up you can see the multiplex drive in the center of the hull sphere.  It's about a meter in diameter, so about ten times the mass of your supergravity drive."</p>

<p>"Why do you call it a multiplex drive?"</p>

<p>"It isn't just a supergravity drive.  It has multiple functions.  Since it was going to be fairly large no matter what, we realized that adding just a bit more functionality could give it some other very useful functions without making it that much bigger.  That has made some other systems simpler or even unnecessary."</p>

<p>"What else does it do?"</p>

<p>"Well it can selectively fold all wavelengths of photons.  We can use it directly as a heater, if we're in the outer system too far from the sun, and while it can't fold electrons since they have mass it can fold photons into the center of a dense photovoltaic array and generate about ten kilowatts of electricity for the artificial lighting and computer systems, and of course to charge the batteries for when the drive is offline.  We had wanted to use it for area illumination but we realized we can only control the size of the aperture, not its transparency, so we have to keep it very small for safety when it's folded to the center of a star."</p>

<p>We ascended the staircase, which was supported by six glass columns about ten centimeters in diameter around a three meter diameter core defined by the columns and holes in the top two decks.  The second deck was just below the equator of the sphere, and the staircase brought us to a pathway through the vegetation.  The multiplex drive was supported by three stalks anchored in the columns opposite the stairway at that level.</p>

<p>"The main path on this level circumnavigates the hull, and leads to sleeping hammocks.  The elimination facilities are also located on this level, with the vegatation providing some privacy.  We don't do a lot of complicated recycling onboard; we depend on returning to a habitable world to restore the atmosphere and water systems to equilibrium."  As she spoke another Promethean approached from the thicket.  "Oh, they're here," he said.  "Sorry but I was a bit busy with last-minute details."</p>

<p>"This is our ship's botanist," our guide said.  "You might prefer to think of him as our life-support engineer."</p>

<p>"We gave you designs for life support systems," M said a bit plaintively.</p>

<p>"Yes, and they were very clever.  Also very difficult.  Exotic materials, toxic and caustic chemicals, high temperature processes.  All stuff we had not been working on.  But we have been farming for almost a hundred thousand years and we know our biome well."</p>

<p>"The mechanical schemes required pressurized oxygen and resources to scrub carbon dioxide, which were either very complicated or used expensive consumables.  And there are other things the biome does which your life support systems don't do.  We do use your methods for our EVA suits but there we accept a lot of limitations."</p>

<p>"We tried this once on Earth you know," M said.  "It didn't work out too well."</p>

<p>"Of course, Biosphere Two," the botanist nodded.  "It lasted what, about two months before they were accused of cheating?"</p>

<p>"Something like that."</p>

<p>"Fortunately we don't anticipate ever being sealed up for more than a week or two, and never even that long once we have the fold drive.  Our design goal for this system is a crew of ten, three engineers and up to seven passengers, for a tour long enough to visit every planet of our system.  But the biome could support sixty for as much as a week in an emergency, with bright sunlight for the biome.  It can support the design crew indefinitely, at least for oxygen generation, on the onboard artificial lighting."</p>

<p>"These plants do okay in variable lighting conditions?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes.  We've been farming for a very long time and not with your industrial methods.  We know our native biome <em>very</em> well."</p>

<p>We ascended to the third level, which was open to the sky.  "Here the navigation walkway follows the inside core guard rail instead of the perimeter and we have a couple of observation and entertainment areas.  This is where we do food preparation with an electrically powered kitchen, and where we would normally gather to eat or have a meeting.  This deck is eleven meters in diameter, but the hull gets quite close to the deck near the perimeter."</p>

<p>"It feels very solid," M said.  "Just how much does this thing weigh?"</p>

<p>"The glass totals two hundred thousand kilograms.  The biome soil, biomass, and support features are another hundred and twenty thousand.  All in all the whole ship masses about four hundred thousand kilograms.  Of course weight doesn't matter when you have a supergravity drive, because every particle falls through the same acceleration gradient when you maneuver."</p>

<p>"How in the hell did you build it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"For that you have to go to the engineers.  We're just the crew.  But they took photographs."</p>

<p>The Prometheans had only primitive black and white film photography, and they used it sparingly.  But they had devoted a crewman to documenting the process of creating the <em>Gift of Guidance</em>'s hull.  They had lofted the glass into space as a solid blob four meters in diameter, then used the multiplex drive to melt it using the sunlight cannon method.</p>

<p>"You built a <em>weapon</em>?" M asked.</p>

<p>"No, we built a <em>furnace</em>, which was your first intended use for the same device.  Wearing EVA suits we used the drive on an open platform space sled to get it high enough to take some time falling, then used compressed gas pumped in through a steel pipe to blow it into a sphere as your Earth glass blowers do.  It didn't take a terribly high pressure in the vacuum of space."</p>

<p>"It's remarkably uniform," M said.</p>

<p>"This was our fourth try.  We let the others crash into the ocean," the guide said as if this was the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>"This seems like an awful lot of effort for something that can't leave your home system," M said as we returned from the engineers' shop.</p>

<p>"But it's not stuck here," our guide said.  "We've been in contact via the microfold and other races assure us they could take us along as their larger ships transfer.  It's actually normal for a nonlanding orbit-only fold ship to generate a fold aperture much larger than its hull."</p>

<p>"Now that you mention it, if I needed to I could even do that with the <em>Plausible Deniability</em>.  We normally keep that ability locked down but I know how to enable it."</p>

<p>"And that brings us to our reason for finally inviting you here.  You see, we have tested everything as much as we can.  We have taken the ship into space and landed it multiple times.  But it is our only ship, and if we have made any mistakes, we have no second chances once we are out in the solar system.  We have never put it in orbit around Prometheus or taken it as far as the orbit of our moon.  We would be grateful if you would accompany us in the <em>Plausible Deniability</em> on our first voyage just in case we need backup."</p>

<p>"We don't have an airlock or docking ring," M said as I nodded.</p>

<p>"We know.  We plan to make this first trip in EVA suits.  We are given to understand that you can evacuate the <em>Plausible</em> a couple of times and recharge the atmosphere if necessary.  We would only need this in some extreme dire unexpected circumstance.  You do have a fold drive, which we don't, and that could be much more useful than an airlock."</p>

<p>M looked at me, and I nodded.  "Of course we would do this.  We would be honored."</p>

<p>"If you don't mind," I said, "and I direct this at M too, she is the one you want in the <em>Plausible</em> if there's an emergency, but I'd like to accompany you in the <em>Gift</em> to see what it is like to actually ride in this thing.  I think you have surpassed us at having the only ship of its kind in the whole galaxy."</p>

<p>"That would be excellent, J," the guide said.  "We would also like our first real voyage to be recorded and human technology is much better for that than ours."</p>

<p>"I guess it's a good thing we lost the fur for now," M said.</p>

<p>"I don't follow?" the guide asked.  "We rather liked your fur."</p>

<p>"Yes, but our EVA suit designers didn't design with it in mind."</p>

<p>Behind our guide one of the Promethean engineers erupted in a fit of coughing-laughter.  "We can see that," she said with a wide grin.  "The problems our suit people had with our own fur were considerable, so if your suits were designed for you to be naked, well it's probably best to wear them that way."</p>

<p>I finally remembered who I really was and forcibly interrupted the playback.  Since he was streaming it to Emma on the same microfold channel it popped both of us back to reality.</p>

<p>"You <em>fucked</em> an Alien Affairs agent?" I said incredulously.</p>

<p>"Oh, she wasn't Alien Affairs.  Those guys manage visas and hospitality arrangements.  She was so secret she was almost your version of a Curator.  I never did learn her real name.  Her agency knows the things nobody else knows and does the things Alien Affairs isn't supposed to do."</p>

<p>"And you <em>fucked</em> her?" Emma said.</p>

<p>"We had human sex," he said.  "It was instructive.  Much of what we have never understood about your species now makes sense to me."</p>

<p>"Yeah, because we're in season all the time," Emma said with a note of disgust in her voice.</p>

<p>"That is correct."  And he held his hand up again.</p>

<p><strong>I AM</strong> surveying a montage of crime scenes this time in the company of my partner and occasional paramour.  We have shaved the window from detection to positioning down to four hours but it still isn't good enough.  Since I have an amplifier belt I can fold her to the scene so she doesn't have to scramble the transport any more.</p>

<p><strong>I AM</strong> relaxing in her bed after sex when she says something curious.  "Your implant, if it was in this world how big would it be?"</p>

<p>I have an idea of what she is getting at and I don't want her to know I have the amplifier, which would be much larger than an implant.  So <strong>I AM HIDING IT</strong> and I mumble something intermediate between the two objects.</p>

<p>"Still far smaller than what we have," she said.  "Our detectors are crude, but they are widely spread out to give useful resolution.  Yours are fine and sensitive but all crammed together in one place along with all the computing power you will ever have.  It takes a lot of computation for us to get results out of our network.  I am wondering if it would be possible to exchange our raw data and share our computational resources to combine and leverage our mutual advantages."</p>

<p>Human built computers are still crude compared to Curator implants, but the agency uses a <em>lot</em> of them.  There is another meeting and <strong>I AM</strong> streaming the raw data back and forth through a high bandwidth microfold portal.  We are taking alternate turns with the sharpening algorithm and the result converges much faster than either of our systems could manage alone.  The early tests look good and when we go to live data the computing lag is cut to two hours.  The first time we try it on Nemesis herself we get a glimpse of the host just before he folds away.</p>

<p>He is a handsome young man with curly auburn hair and a rakish moustache.  <strong>I AM</strong> realizing that <strong>I HAVE NO PLAN</strong>.</p>

<p>"We need a plan," she is saying, and <strong>I AM</strong> nodding.</p>

<p>The agency arranges fake data leading to actors who will let us test our ability to home in and take our target down.  <strong>I AM</strong> critical to the project because I can fold us to the target instantly.  <strong>I AM</strong> learning from her some of the skills of human spycraft so that when we get to the scene we can act together as a team.  The agency is incorporating my abilities into their plan scenarios as adeptly as if they had been using my abilities themselves for their whole careers.</p>

<p><strong>I AM</strong> getting the alarm and streaming the data to the human servers.  <strong>I AM</strong> getting dressed with her in case the results come out and when they do <strong>I AM</strong> folding us to a position just out of sight of the fold event.  We know that she doesn't travel far from where she folds, rather picking victims who can be attacked conveniently without risk exactly where they are when she arrives.  Her host is in the middle of a deserted street far from the nearest city hacking his victim apart.  I survey the situation with my microfold senses and fold the agent in to do her thing.  Then I fold in myself in time to see her drive the power syringe into his neck.</p>

<p>The host reels and faces us, not realizing what has been done to him.  I have put up the fold inhibitor field and when he tries to fold out the agent and I follow.  He makes it about five short hops before he drops to his knees and looks at us with genuine puzzlement in his eyes.</p>

<p>"You gave me H?" he says incredulously.</p>

<p>"The euphoria is just a side effect," the agent says as we watch him gradually collapse.  "Normally the euphoria is the intended goal and our result is the side effect, but here it's the other way around."</p>

<p>He is losing control of his body.  "Waaat dee foook you deeeed to meeeee," he manages to slur.</p>

<p><strong>I AM</strong> holding the inhibitor field up; it is causing some local disruptions but I won't need it for long.  He is losing the ability to coordinate a command to the implant.  </p>

<p>"Conscious imperative instructions to our implants go through an area of the brain called the substantia nigra," <strong>I AM SAYING</strong> to her.  "The injection my partner just gave you selectively kills those brain cells.  You're still alive and the rest of your brain is performing normally so your implant won't detach, but you can't give it any kind of instruction directed at performing a definite action."</p>

<p>The host's muscles are locking as his brain's motor control center dies.  Finally he can no longer speak.</p>

<p>"I am in communication with her through the implant," I tell my partner.  "Those functions don't go through the substantia nigra."</p>

<p>"What is she saying?"</p>

<p>"She's howling in rage."</p>

<p>"Sounds reasonable."</p>

<p>"I think I can do it now."</p>

<p>"Please do, before he overdoses on the opioid and actually dies."</p>

<p><strong>I AM</strong> exercising my unlocked powers and the knowledge of codes which have been forgotten for aeons to perform a full reset on her implant.  There are alarms and opportunities for her to cancel before the operation proceeds but the brain cells she needs to do that have already been killed.  Her implant backup will be deleted and the implant itself will automatically return to the manufactory to be recycled.</p>

<p>"She's gone," I say.  "It's just him and whatever's left of her in his brain now."</p>

<p>She produces a gun and aims it at him.</p>

<p><strong>I AM</strong> saying let me handle this, this will make you a murderer.</p>

<p>"Honey, killing people is one of the things I do and in all my career I have never killed anyone who I will feel better about killing than this fucker."  And she points the gun at his face and pulls the trigger twice.</p>

<p>The vision ends with the sound of the shots, not looking down to reveal the result.  "We didn't need to see that," the Curator said.</p>

<p>"So are you still fucking the agent?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"It was a working relationship and our work was done.  I re-quieted my host's feelings and I assume she went back to more mundane aspects of her own job."</p>

<p>"Such as spying and killing people," I said.</p>

<p>"So it seems."</p>

<p>"And you are cool with this?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"If not for her and her agency there might have been no way to stop Nemesis.  Your people have always had a tendency to suspend your norms in case of an exigent circumstance, and this was one of those circumstances.  I have learned a lot from this project."</p>

<p>"I'm a little afraid to ask just <em>what</em> you learned from it," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, for one I learned that Remy Martin XO is perfectly adequate."</p>

<p>"Considering what it costs most people would find it a lot better than adequate."</p>

<p>"I don't know, the clear hooch that your professors make is also pretty smooth.  But another thing I learned is that I can probably never go back to Earth."</p>

<p>Emma and I looked at one another.  "Why?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"I realized over a year ago that they were never all that interested in stopping Nemesis from conducting her murder spree.  They were far more interested in studying her to learn what they could of our technology.  She was a Curator who regularly acted in a predictable enough way for them to find and study her.  They shifted focus when I showed up because I was also a Curator and they could work with me directly.  I gave them enough information to keep them interested and held back enough to keep them harmless to us.  But on that final mission she had a second syringe."</p>

<p>"<em>What?</em>"</p>

<p>"With my human sexual feelings awakened I became fond of surveying her bioform with my microfold array even when she was dressed.  On our final mission she had a second syringe.  She had no legitimate reason to have it because in the unlikely event that she somehow missed with the first one, our protocol was supposed to be to let Nemesis fold out without warning her that we also had an inhibitor field ready to deploy."</p>

<p>"Before we engaged Nemesis, she invited me to celebrate with her if we found success.  I agreed but when she shot the host I folded out.  I folded through fifteen worlds, including one that is the lifeless airless husk of a world fried by its exploding star, before coming here.  They do not know I am your friend and there is no way for them to trace me here.  I think joining your project is my only remaining option."</p>

<p>"She was just using you to get at your technology?"</p>

<p>"Well I was using her to stop Nemesis, so I can't complain about that."</p>

<p>"What about Nemesis' implant?" Emma asked.  "Is there any chance they might recover it?"</p>

<p>"It has almost certainly already found its way back to the manufactory to be recycled."</p>

<p>"Won't that alert your people that someone killed her?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily.  It's not unknown for those of us who are tired of life to not only burn our bioforms but to reset our own implants, effectively committing permanent suicide.  The implants return to where they were made to be repurposed.  They will know it was her implant but they also know she had gone mad.  No, the real problem is the human agency."</p>

<p>"They do not know that my powers are greater than those of an ordinary Curator, and it is likely that they will attempt more operations to interact with my people.  It seems inevitable that their incorrect assumptions will eventually alert my people to the fact that I have those advantages, advantages that not only require an amplifier but the long suppressed ability to arbitrarily reprogram it."</p>

<p>"My people will then figure out that I <em>used</em> those advantages to kill another Curator.  And doing that, even to an evil <em>scree</em> like Nemesis will annoy them.  By their own arrangement there's not much they can do to me, but I doubt they will ever allow me to work on a project with them again."</p>

<p>"Well we can always use your help here," Emma said.</p>

<p>He nodded and took a sip of white lightning.  "And I will need guidance as I let my human feelings out again, with a bit more caution this time.  Part of me may have been born on another world a million years before you evolved, but it seems that for now my fate is to be human.  And it is a fate I have decided to embrace.  In fact I have realized that Nemesis was right about one thing which I must do."</p>

<p>"What is that?" I asked warily.</p>

<p>"I should take a name.  You have been calling me 'Curator' for over a hundred years now, and now that I am expressing my humanity I think something less formal and generic might be appropriate.  I am thinking of calling myself Andrew."</p>

<p>There was an awkward moment as I wondered how to ask <em>why the hell Andrew</em>.  Then Emma said "Well, Andrew, welcome to Terra Nova," and she held out her hand.  We made our introductions as if we had never met before and we finished off the bottle together.</p>

<p>I chose an area of the indexed world where night was about to fall so that I wouldn't be disturbed. In my private room at the inn I mentally unpacked the blast of information Helen had sent me in the seconds before she destroyed the Plasma base.</p>

<p>It was very well organized, suggesting both that she had been preparing it for some time and that her Ancestor's experience had guided her work.  I followed the conspicuous tag that flashed
<strong>START HERE</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Uncle Andrew, when we thought we had as much time as we might need to unravel the mess
being made by the Plasma, we were wrong.  Fortunately their plans for me required
me to be involved in the earliest stages or we might have missed our 
window of opportunity.  I believe
you are likely to visit here again before I have to either deploy with them or act, 
but if that does not happen I have prepared a slightly different version of this and
secreted it with the Witnesses, who will arrange to get it to you if I do not keep
our dead man's switch updated.</p>

<p>They are building new construction bays as I write this and planning to accelerate their
deployment schedule to within a fifty Earth-year window.  Worse, they plan to begin
staging personnel and planet killers throughout the human galaxies beginning in the 
near future.  If we let them begin this process the planet killers and Plasma agents 
will be scattered and our chance to eliminate them all with one stroke will be lost.</p>

<p>Fortunately they wanted to make sure I am solidly in position to destroy Deucalion, 
so much so that I am to be among their first wave of deployed agents.  I am fairly
certain that they are all still cowering here from the fold-following worm but I have
been told to be ready to leave this base within a few months.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She showed me a series of images of the new construction bays being built from tours given
to her by the senior agents.  She was now a small but important key in their plan and
they wanted to show her trust and respect.  She affected to be impressed skillfully;
I was sure this was Veronica's training and her work among the Curator exiles coming
in useful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I did ask them what was to become of me once I destroyed Deucalion if every other
habitable world in the galaxy was to be destroyed at the same time, and my implant
would not be able to find its way back to the Milky Way so I could find a new host.
They insisted there was a plan for that but wouldn't tell me exactly what it was.
I suspect it's the same plan they have for the non-implanted help here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She showed me another tour of the murder ball inventory caves.  While she already
had the coordinates from me she was able to verify that the inventory was a bit
loose due to the failure rate, and that they would in fact want her to take <em>two</em>
of the planet killers to Deucalion in case the first failed.  She verified that 
manually arming them would require a code which she would be given when she reached
the Pinwheel and she was assigned specific weapons.  But she also verified that they
would trigger automatically without being otherwise armed in the same manner as the
prototype that had destroyed Terminus -- fold it to any place of atmospheric vacuum,
then to the presence of a nearby world and star, and automatic mayhem.</p>

<p>She returned to the cave a week later and took one of the weapons.  It would have
been a bit large for her to fold it offworld to an interstellar destination, but 
it was within our normal payload capacity for a local same-world hop.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am attaching some code pages which you will probably find interesting.  I'm sure it
occurs to you that if these people take their implants to the center of the Sun, 
they will just go into emulation and find new hosts and start it all up again.  And
even if I could give them all the fold-following worm quickly enough that they don't
notice what is happening, if the weapon creates a solar bomb instead of folding the
world away then some of them might have time to voluntarily fold themselves away to
safety.  I could not allow that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The worm she created used the Level 1 pass code, two security layers deeper and more
ancient than the one I'd used to make my worm.  It was more complex and wove its
changes gradually so that its presence would not be noticed.  But it also exposed a
trigger which could be activated by a basic microfold broadcast and lock down the
whole implant in microseconds.  Not only would fold-following be disabled, so would
deliberate implant folding and further microfold communications.  The Curator would 
be trapped and unable to call for help.</p>

<p>I realized that this was why Helen had tried my Level Zero pass code the first time
we met.  That was the only way to permanently disable my Level 1 code so I'd be safe
from this attack.  But I'd already done it myself.</p>

<p>My fold-following worm was a quick hack.  Hers was a beautiful expression of the
hacker's art.  And she'd done it without the benefit of my years of study with
human hackers.  This had to be the skill of her Ancestor at work, both deeply familiar
with the underlying architecture the Curators were still using and with ways of
subverting that architecture.</p>

<p>She revealed her attack plan for the moment of my arrival.  The broadcast of this
information package to me would take several seconds.  This would be just after 
the broadcast of her implant worm trigger.  She would wait until all the semaphores
were set indicating that the trigger had reached every infected target within range,
and then she would fold herself out to the orbit of the moon, but opposite the actual
orb, and then after a few seconds to allow the weapon to sample vacuum back down to 
within a few thousand kilometers of the surface of the base world.</p>

<p>That part of her plan had worked.  I also understood that she had a backup plan in 
case the stolen weapon didn't work, to fold back to the storage cave and grab another 
one.  That would introduce other risks but at that point she couldn't be concerned with 
her own personal survival.</p>

<p>I reviewed the rest of her data dump and decided to take a walk outside.  It was now
deep nighttime and because this was a typical Curated world, unlike a human world, 
there were no outdoor floodlights and it was quite dark.  The moon was up though so
it was possible to navigate the landscape.</p>

<p>There was no precedent for this.  I simply didn't have any idea what to do.  I felt
helpless.  I was tiptoeing on the edge of a precipice that had no bottom.  </p>

<p>There was a list of known Plasma agents living on Earth, because the fold following
worm had gotten them.  And there was a list of "suspect individuals," Curator exiles
whom the Plasma felt might be unreliable or even hostile.  I noticed that the one 
who had given me the original prototype murder ball was on that list.</p>

<p>I clearly needed to visit Earth.  But that would mean a trip through the inhibitor
field,  and before committing to that there was someone else I wanted to consult.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Homeless received my vision in rapt attention.  I began with my own memory of 
my arrival and Helen's greeting and the subsequent moments, then I played them her
message to me.  When I was done I waited for somebody to say something.</p>

<p>"The fools," the Pessimist finally said.  Several others grumbled in agreement.</p>

<p>"Can you elaborate?"</p>

<p>"We had a chance to atone.  Clearly it might have been possible to reconstruct our
technology from the scattered scraps that remained in this galaxy.  It would have
taken aeons, but we are patient by nature.  But these fools took it all, gathered
it in this single place, and used it to do something so evil that you were perfectly
justified in destroying it all again.  This will be your galaxy now."</p>

<p>"I'm actually one of you," I reminded them.</p>

<p>"You have one of our implants, but you haven't been one of us for a long time,"
one of the others said.  "I would say we should all seek human hosts for the
survival of our kind, but we understand humans can detect that and don't tolerate
it."</p>

<p>"That's true," I said.  "If your line in the sand is the simultaneous expression
of multiple instances of a thought matrix, for humans it's what they consider the
subversion of a human child's natural development."</p>

<p>"There will be much for us to learn in this new galaxy," yet another said.  "Is there
any possibility for peaceful coexistence between us after this?"</p>

<p>"Humans have always had their own renegades," I said.  "It may take what they would
think of as a long time, but humans can be brought around to understand that you 
aren't all the Plasma.  If those of you who remain conduct yourselves with honor,
you can become valued allies.  Such things have happened many times in their past."</p>

<p>"I think your friend just took care of most of the ones who wouldn't conduct
themselves appropriately," the Pessimist said.  "Do you know what became of Helen?"</p>

<p>"I suspect she went into emulation," I said.  "She could turn up anywhere if she
decides to take another host."</p>

<p>"Except Earth," someone said.</p>

<p>"Most likely," I agreed.</p>

<p>Before I left I quietly cured them of the fold-following worm they had once asked me
to share with them, but I did it without resetting the Level 3 pass code.  They would
think they were still infected, but they would no longer actually lose their implants
if someone folded them off by surprise.  I could have told them, but they <em>are</em> patient
by nature, and I figured they would notice it eventually.</p>

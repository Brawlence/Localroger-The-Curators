<p>When I decided to study dermatology I never dreamed it would result in my becoming an astronaut, much less visiting actual aliens on their starship.  But the foldship was now getting closer and closer and bigger and bigger through the windows of the personnel shuttle and when I finally spotted the docking ring humans had given them it was like a wedding ring lost on the side of a mountain.</p>

<p>I had been told there were fifteen hundred individuals of twenty-two species on the ship, and they were all manner of scaly, furry, feathered, and naked.  The human habit of wearing clothes didn't seem to be a big thing off-Earth and was a source of some curiosity among our hosts.  My primary host, the researcher I call K because I can't pronounce any of the alien names, allowed as to how there were some species who had what he called deviant modesty habits here and there in the galaxy.  It was a primary suspicion of it that we were hiding our Marks of the Curator for some reason until I allowed it to inspect my dermis thoroughly.  Fortunately it shared my values as a doctor and was as courteous as it could be despite its agitation.</p>

<p>The ship wasn't spinning but it had some kind of local interior gravity.  I guess we hadn't got that memo yet from the Curators either.</p>

<p>There were a few other scientists on the shuttle but most of the passengers were diplomats.  The aliens seemed quite puzzled that we had no single world authority they could correspond with.  For practical reasons their worlds all had different governments, and of many different forms and philosophies, but each of their worlds tended to be unified.  Our guys reminded them that we are a very young species by their standards, having only mastered steam travel a couple of hundred years ago.  They seemed astonished that we had gotten into space so quickly after that.  Apparently the Curators don't pass out the gifts quite that often.</p>

<p>Finally I was in a stateroom which had been furnished to a pretty decadent human standard.  Apparently there were dozens of architects and living space designers on their crew, and our world had presented them with a new pallette of playthings.  The distilled liquor I requested was indistinguishable from Jack Daniel's even though I knew they had synthesized it on the ship.  "We didn't need a very large sample, and when we knew you favored it we had one of the other guests bring us a few drops to analyze," K told me.</p>

<p>"I still don't know why I'm here," I said as I sipped my Jack D. while lounging in a bathrobe in my decadent starship stateroom.</p>

<p>"You know your species' skin better than anybody, and it is the mark of the Curators we seek," K said.</p>

<p>"I thought we had pretty well established that the Curators haven't marked humans, and don't seem to have done anything noticeable on Earth since the unfortunate ex-dinosaur business."</p>

<p>"That seems likely, but my colleagues will need more evidence before they believe that."</p>

<p>I sighed heavily, imagining myself doing the disrobing and examination thing in an auditorium.  The sacrifices we make for knowledge.</p>

<p>The lights turned red and started blinking.  "What the hell is this?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, the foldship is leaving Earth," K said.</p>

<p>"And when is it coming back?" I asked with a bit of bite in my voice.  I had just meant to visit the ship, not to leave the Solar System with it.</p>

<p>"It will come back when it is appropriate."  And as I watched through the window the image of the Earth became dim, as though seen through a grey filter, until it was barely visible.  Then there was an impossibly bright flash of light, and when my vision recovered I was looking at an alien starfield and a gas giant planet.</p>

<p>"Surely nobody lives there," I said.  It was dimly lit and it seemed likely that even a moon couldn't possibly get enough sunlight to harbor life.</p>

<p>"No, we will perform a few fold maneuvers in the gas planet's gravitational field to adjust our local velocity before folding over to our host world.  We did the same thing when we arrived at Sol, using the gravity of your solar world Neptune to match velocity with your Earth."</p>

<p>"Wait, if you can fold the ship from the bottom of a gravity well out of it, doesn't that make the fold drive a perpetual motion machine?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it violates your so-called 'first law of thermodynamics.'  We create energy to power the ship and our cities using similar principles."</p>

<p>"This is going to drive our physicists nuts."</p>

<p>"A failure to accept it was part of your physicists' problem creating your own fold drive.  Now that we have proven it is possible they are well on their way to success."</p>

<p>Five Earth days later we were orbiting a blue world, one which was Earthlike but also very obviously not Earth.  The shuttles which came to ferry us to the surface were powered by some kind of field projected from the surface; this was also used to launch the components to be assembled into large structures like the foldship itself.  But the generator required a local gravity well to work and so could not be used in space, which is why we humans had to provide ferry service at Earth.  I learned that our hosts were quite bemused at our use of chemical rockets, which they had never bothered to develop to such a high degree.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind I'd like to take a sample of your flesh so that we can sequence your genome ourselves," K said.  "It's not that we don't trust you or your skills, but the idea that you've been untouched by the Curators is going to be very hard for some of us to believe and it would make a better case if we used methods we know."</p>

<p>I allowed blood and saliva samples to be taken and a detailed photographic survey to be taken of my skin.  Most of the other humans on board were diplomats and engineers and I verified that human modesty habits would make them bristle at similar requests.</p>

<p>The following day K and I took the shuttle to the surface and visited the genetics lab.  It took about an hour for them to sequence my genome, and as the results unfolded the operator of the sequencing machine changed hue until it was a spectacular bright green.  "This is quite remarkable," it kept saying.</p>

<p>"Can you explain just how?"</p>

<p>"Your genome does contain fragments of Curator marks," it said.  "But they are highly mutated.  It has been hundreds of thousands of generations since the Curators touched your ancestors.  The last thing I can be fairly sure they did was making your ancestors omnivorous."</p>

<p>"That was probably a few million years ago," I said.</p>

<p>"Exactly, and yet you have language, civilization, architecture, and <em>space travel</em>.  Clearly all without their help.  This is unprecedented."</p>

<p>"Just how do you tell?  Remember that we've never seen any of these gifts so we don't know what you're looking for."</p>

<p>K turned dark red.  "Of course.  We simply hadn't thought of that.  Let's go to the museum."</p>

<p>The same generator that powered space shuttles powered flying ground transports, so the aliens had what were basically flying cars.  They were also automatic and self-navigating, and shared in some kind of public system.  We were at the museum which was half a continent away in about an hour.  K produced a set of what looked oddly like eyeglasses.  "I had these made to your species' form factor," K said.  "They should make it possible for you to interpret the exhibits."</p>

<p>I put them on and looked at the front of the building; the indecipherable squiggle above the door suddenly said "Museum of Curator Artifacts."  We went inside.</p>

<p>"We can skip the early exhibits, which are about the development of habitable worlds and life, since we are pretty sure the Curators did do those things on Earth."  Toward the back of the building we reached an exhibit with a large flat rock covered with diagrams, and inlaid with gemstones.  At the center was some kind of agate that glowed red.  The sign called this a "Prometheus Stone."</p>

<p>"This was the gift of how to make fire for some ancient people," K said.  "This one is a replica; they are given to very primitive races so most have been lost or destroyed even though the gift of fire itself remained.  Only four of the genuine article are known to exist in the galaxy.  It is quite possible there is one on Earth, or was once, because it seems to be associated with the diet-widening modification you were given."</p>

<p>"Our ancestors were herbivorous and couldn't eat meat until we learned to cook it," I said.  "Fire and omnivorism are thought to be closely linked for us.  But it is also thought that we may have spent a long period of time harvesting fire from natural sources like lightning strikes before we learned to make it from scratch."  The Prometheus Stone illustrations showed the making and use of a fire drill, a method human adventurers still use to make fire under primitive conditions.</p>

<p>I spent two days going through the museum.  The aliens were quite obsessed with the details of their gifts and had learned a lot about how the Curators had helped them, if very little about the Curators themselves or their ultimate motivations.</p>

<p>"The foldship will soon return to Earth, but I would like to suggest an alternate destination for you," K said.  "There is another foldship we can take to <em>screee</em> which is the homeworld of another relatively young race.  They are still doing archaeology and it would give you a chance to see some actual Curator artifacts and meet people who are doing current research on the Curators.  They would probably also like to meet a member of your species, given your remarkable lack of Curation."</p>

<p>I could think of a hundred reasons why it was a bad idea, but in the end I couldn't resist.  All the diplomats and engineers returned to Earth, but I became the first of my species to visit two alien worlds.</p>

<p>As I climbed down from the thing that had once been just an airplane, it hit me hard that this was a starship, a human-built and human-owned starship, and we had just taken it to a world circling another star without any help from anybody.  They hadn't put a lot of effort into cosmetic customization and it was still the same drab semi-camo olive green they love for subsonic warplanes that don't have the sexy new stealth stuff going for them.  I realized the foldship project had probably rescued it from a scrap pile.</p>

<p>"Does this thing have a name?" I asked M as she secured her gear.</p>

<p>"We call it the test article," she said with a shrug.  "It's the only one of its kind we have."</p>

<p>"Well it won't be for long.  Do you think it's a good idea for the history books to say we just took humanity's first self propelled trip to another star in the 'test article'?"</p>

<p>She looked at the craft thoughtfully.  "Well I hear <em>you're</em> the namer of alien worlds.  What would you call it?"</p>

<p>"I'd favor <em>Firefly</em>, except that's kind of used... wait, it's green and we went from the ground here to the ground there.  How about <em>Grasshopper</em>?"</p>

<p>She looked at the craft thoughtfully then motioned for me to follow.  We winded among aircraft, mostly in various states of disassembly, until we got to a mechanics' area.  "Are the paint guys here?" M asked loudly.</p>

<p>"Yeah, we're here."</p>

<p>"Can I get the name <em>Grasshopper</em> painted on the fold project test article?"</p>

<p>"By whose authority?"</p>

<p>"I'm the aircraft's commander."</p>

<p>Once the higher-ups realized what had happened M and I were separated for debriefing.  Since we hadn't thought to record it they went over our conversation with the Curator until everyone was sure we had it right syllable for syllable, and different sketch artists worked from our descriptions.  Finally we were reunited in a conference room where we faced about thirty people, mostly scientists and engineers with military backgrounds, before the Director.</p>

<p>"This is not a tribunal or anything like that," the Director told us.  "We just need to figure out where we stand, and you're at the focal point right now."</p>

<p>M and I both nodded.</p>

<p>"How serious is the threat these Curators pose?"</p>

<p>M gave me an "I'm just the pilot" look.  Of course in addition to being a test pilot she was a graduate level physicist and part of the team that had built the fold drive, but of the two of us I was apparently the diplomat.</p>

<p>"If we piss them off enough it's existential," I said, "but I think he wanted to make it clear that it would also be hard to piss them off that much and fairly easy to keep them uninterested in us.  Going to a quarantined critical path world is one of the <em>few</em> things they really care about."</p>

<p>"And what was the nature of the threat he made if you would have stayed?"</p>

<p>I looked at M.  "He threatened to fold us off to the other side of the galaxy.  We would have had no way to navigate home or even to find nearby habitable worlds.  It would have been a death sentence."</p>

<p>"But not a threat to Earth.  Not to fold us into the Sun."</p>

<p>"Not in that case.  But he did make it clear that it had gone that far before with a few other species.  Sometimes they do have to weed their galactic garden."</p>

<p>The voices changed but the tone didn't really.  These were mostly military personnel and they didn't like the idea of limits being placed on them.  "What does it take to piss them off that much?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure I want to know," I said.  "Do we really need to push them?"</p>

<p>The Director spoke up.  "In all our talks with aliens, none have ever mentioned a conversation like this with a Curator.  They get gifts, but never interaction.  Not even the most distant stories or legends of such an encounter.  No hint that they know or even think that the Curators walk among them in disguise.  We'll have to follow this up but I have to think this was a pretty extraordinary intervention on their part."</p>

<p>"He called the ship 'wonderful' and 'unique,'" M said.  "I had the impression he was using our language very precisely -- J?"</p>

<p>"I agree," I said.  "Those were the only superlatives he used except for the ones describing our fetish for murder."</p>

<p>"The test article is just a tiny test ship not even capable of docking with another vessel or carrying passengers in proper spacesuits," someone in the audience said.  "It doesn't even make a proper substitute for our rocket shuttles to their fold ships.  What could possibly make it so extraordinary?"</p>

<p>M seemed to be looking into some far place.  "It's a grasshopper," she said.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"J did his naming thing again," the Director said.  "The test article is being named <em>Grasshopper</em> for whatever reason.  M is its commander so it's her right and decision."</p>

<p>"We departed the surface of a planet, folded, and landed on the surface of another planet.  They can't do that.  <em>None</em> of them can do that.  Isn't that right, J?"</p>

<p>M had never met an alien other than the Curator, but I had spent hundreds of hours talking to them.  "I think you might be right."</p>

<p>"It's a self contained ship that can leave from the surface of a world, fold to another, and land on its surface.  All their foldships require ground support to do transport from ground to orbit.  We don't even <em>need</em> to orbit because we can just drop into the atmosphere and land on the damn surface."  Her eyes got wider.  "And the Curators do it their own way, with the even higher technology.  We crossed a barrier they set for their children, in a way they didn't expect."  She took a sip of water.  "They've been doing this curation thing for eight billion years and they've never seen it before," she said in a tone of awe.</p>

<p>"That seems like..."</p>

<p>"...exactly what happened," I said.  "I was there, and she's right.  The Curator was impressed, and he was establishing position."  I took a sip of water.  "He made a point of mentioning that he could pass for human even in a hospital.  I think he meant that for me, since I'm a doctor.  He <em>knew</em> I was a doctor.  He wanted to remind me that they have a very fine degree of control over biology.  As if the <em>mark of the Curators</em> hadn't suggested that.  Forgive me rocket scientists, but I think getting to the stage of disguising yourself as an alien life form effectively enough to present at an alien hospital is probably a bit harder than even making a fold drive."</p>

<p>"Could your visitor have simply been human?"</p>

<p>"If so, one well equipped with alien technology, well versed in their technology and culture, and ready to go to action in a matter of days.  As M mentioned the precision of his language, I also tend to think he wouldn't do prevarication.  The Curators operate from a point from which such unpleasantness just isn't necessary.  When you really have the power you don't have to misrepresent what you can do."</p>

<p>"We need to carefully explore our options," the Director said.  "While I'm currently more worried by what our own idiots would do with a fold drive, we may have made a faux pas here.  What are the permitted parameters?  We don't need <em>another</em> threat from godlike aliens."</p>

<p>"If I may offer a suggestion," a very old gentleman said from the back of the room.  Unlike most of the participants he wasn't wearing a uniform.  "As I understand, we have visited two types of alien world, a few civilized worlds with space travel and now a 'critical path' world with a species transitioning from agriculture to space travel.  Did the alien not say they didn't care about worlds that hadn't reached the critical path?"</p>

<p>"That is exactly what he said," M and I said more or less simultaneously.</p>

<p>"So we humans completed the critical path much faster than normal, but it normally takes at most a hundred thousand or maybe even a million years.  And of course those worlds which have completed the critical path are potential enemies if we try to invade them.  But the Earth was habitable for beings such as ourselves for most of half a billion years before we finally emerged to start on our own critical path.  The Curators have been making worlds like the Earth all over the galaxy for aeons.  It seems that many, maybe even most, of those worlds in the habitable zone with properly placed moons and water and introduced life must be somewhere between our Cambrian Explosion and the rise of our own agricultural ancestors."</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"If I am reading this transcript right, I think we were just offered those worlds if we want them."</p>

<p>M and I looked at one another, and our eyes widened in recognition.  The Curator had told us the worlds we weren't allowed to go to and the worlds he expected to challenge us if we threatened them.  He hadn't mentioned that there were a lot of others nobody cared about waiting to be explored or even colonized.  The negative space in his warning was our gift.</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't the other aliens have gone to these worlds?" another voice asked.</p>

<p>M seemed to grow about half a meter and said "Because they can't get to the ground!  The aliens' fold drives are big and their fold ships are too big to land so they need to orbit, and they need ground based support to travel from orbit to the surface.  But <em>we</em> have a ship that can simply go to the ground and get back up without ground support on any world with an oxygen atmosphere."</p>

<p>"Which," I said, "thanks to the Curators, should be a lot of them."</p>

<p>It was suddenly obvious why the Curator had called the <em>Grasshopper</em> "wonderful."</p>

<p>"May I ask who you are?" M asked of the man who had made this suggestion.</p>

<p>"Oh, I just wrote a couple of science fiction stories.  But these guys liked them."</p>

<p>"Why can't the aliens make a craft like our ... <em>Grasshopper</em>?"</p>

<p>Another authoritative voice.  "They make everything of nanites, so their methods are coarse.  Nanites are seductively convenient but once they bond themselves in place to make a larger thing, a lot of the underlying structure is still there for now mission-useless things like moving around and energy conversion and following the assembly plan.  The coarseness limits the resolution of their fold operations.  The smallest fold drive they can make is bigger than the entire <em>Grasshopper</em>, and far too heavy to make a winged much less VTOL surface landing."</p>

<p>"What about the alien folding off the world directly?"</p>

<p>"If they made that fold drive by true nanoassembly, an atom at a time, that kind of precision should be possible in a device you could put in your pocket," another voice said.  "We've been arguing in our group about whether that could ever be possible.  I think our astronauts have given us a direction for research."</p>

<p>I felt a bit of a swell at that.  I wasn't just a dermatologist, even a world-famous one with celebrity clients.  I was an <em>astronaut</em>.</p>

<p>"Is that kind of assembly even possible?" someone asked.</p>

<p>"The nanites do it themselves in the process of reproduction.  They nanodisassemble one of their own kind and execute a gang copy operation simultaneously making millions of atom by atom copies.  This process is also how they copy things like small amounts of frozen food and drink.  But the nanites cannot create new designs, only copy what already exists, and in very small chunks.  To make a pocket fold drive you'd have to make an original design the size of, say, a balled fist all in one go.  That involves a hell of a lot of atomic placements."</p>

<p>"It must be possible though, if our witnesses are accurate."</p>

<p>"There is another thing," someone else said.  "The ability to make a fold drive implies the ability to detect fold operations at a distance.  This is how the Sevillians found us.  But all during our research we have detected occasional hints of fold activity at close range and small scale.  We have observed such events on almost a daily basis.  We had written them off as noise or interference, but this suggests the possibility that we are detecting Curator activity."</p>

<p>The room erupted in a chorus of exclamations.  The Director had to pound his folding table to restore order.  </p>

<p>"Wouldn't the aliens have detected these activities?"</p>

<p>"They build their fold drives in orbit, and their resolution is low.  For their equipment it probably would be below the true noise threshold."</p>

<p>"I think we have several courses for new action," the Director almost shouted.  "The fold drive team needs to look into these possible Curator fold events.  The nanite team needs to look into nanoassembly at larger scale, and liaise with the fold team about what they might need you to be able to do to move forward.  We have completed and are testing another actual fold drive assembly, with a third nearing completion, and we need to be considering what kind of craft to make with them.  And our pilot and ambassador need to find us worlds we can safely explore and colonize."</p>

<p>"How will we find them?"  M asked.</p>

<p>"I have a surprise of my own.  At about the time you were leaving the critical path world, we received a gift from the Curators.  Apparently our first in a long time."  He showed us a keychain memory unit.  "It was encrypted with our best algorithm, using our own administrative password, and placed on one of our most secure servers in a place where we couldn't fail to notice it.  Our network guys were quite impressed, but if the Curators can really pass as human and fold past our security systems it might not imply that great of a computer hacking ability.  Anyway it is a digital map of the galaxy.  The instructions are in Esperanto and very clear.  It lists every quarantined world and every developed world in the galaxy.  I checked, and Earth is there.  We are listed as developed and spacefaring, just like Seville and Pompeii."</p>

<p>"How does that help us find undeveloped worlds?" someone asked.</p>

<p>"The Curators have been curating worlds for aeons.  Given the incubation time there should be plenty that aren't listed.  If we find a world that's habitable and not on this list, it should be open."</p>

<p>Finding Earthlike worlds is hard at interstellar distances but not so hard when you can visit a star and flit about it with the fold drive.  Within three weeks we had an instrumentation package for the <em>Grasshopper</em> that made it possible to map all the worlds of a candidate solar system within an hour or two by doing a dozen sky scans from the vertices of an imaginary icosahedron around the star.  After that our main immediate limitation was that we had only one craft to do both the sky surveys and ground investigations.  Even so, within a month M and I had found and walked on half a dozen Earthlike worlds, and nobody had challenged us about our presence on any of them.</p>

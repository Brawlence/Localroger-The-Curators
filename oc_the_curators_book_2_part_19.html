<p>Less than a week after our appointment with the Critical Path Curator, the <em>Nostromo</em> made its way to the world Red was calling Terra Nova.  There were three hundred people on board for the expedition, with over fifty already at our destination via the personnel carriers.  Emma and I went along for the ride with everyone else so as to blend in.</p>

<p>There was a flurry of activity as the biologists who had been on the ground transmitted results and conveyed samples to the ship.  "We've been surveying the smaller species worldwide," one of the biologists told us.  "We need to see what family distinctions are there, particularly at the biomolecular level, that might allow us to make specific diseases or toxins."</p>

<p>"Isn't it a bit early to be planning on the worst case scenario?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"If we need it, we'll need to have the planning already done."</p>

<p>"I really think those measures will be more necessary with the mid-range animals, which are far more numerous but still fairly powerful.  We may be able to do like our own ancestors and get them to flock over the edges of cliffs but we don't know their behavioral habits very well yet, and some of the smaller megafauna appear to be solitary.  The big guys we will hunt to extinction, and we even have to figure out how we're going to do <em>that</em>."</p>

<p>Red introduced us to a big man who had made himself the very stereotype of the mercenery hunter, dressing in camo and carrying a big knife and a revolver even on the ship as if a big carnivore might surprise him in the mess hall without warning.  He was friendly though, and unlike most of the crew he recognized us instantly.  </p>

<p>"Queen Emma and King Jay, welcome to Terra Nova.  I'm Zeke.  I have to give the highest respect to the only two humans to ever go into battle in space," he said.  "Any advice for how to handle it?"</p>

<p>"When you're facing off against a mountain-sized fold ship in a lightly built tin can, make sure you have the better weapons," Emma said, and the mountain-sized man laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"That's excellent advice, and I'll be taking it seriously very soon.  I'd be honored if you two would witness my hunt.  I plan to take down the first of the big guys on this ball of mud so the bio guys can get their samples.  And maybe try some barbecue."</p>

<p>"Guys like him make me want to give the dinos machine guns," Emma mumbled after he had walked off.  "He didn't even say anything about that little incident where we unified the government and claimed our throne."</p>

<p>"Well we know what he cares about," I said.</p>

<p>Zeke's hunt was to be quite the spectacle though.  He had outfitted an open flying sled with a fully automatic Browning M-2 50 caliber machine gun.  The sled itself was basically a plate with the gun tripod and a chair for Zeke mounted to it.  "Wouldn't something with a little protection for you be a good idea?" Emma asked him as we viewed it.  "Going up against a capital fold ship in a tin can wasn't much fun."</p>

<p>"I've seen estimates of these guys' bite force," Zeke said.  "I'd rather have a clear shot than a cage that bad boy can crush."</p>

<p>Scouts located a promising target and the observation craft formed a distant circle before Zeke moved in.  These were just bigger floating plates, but we were high enough to be out of range of any of the animals and Red had supplied us all with binoculars.  They were autofocus, had active image stabilization, built in rangefinder and target size reticules, but they were old-school in that the light passed directly from the target through a couple of quality lenses to the eye without being digitized in between.  Just like being there yourself.</p>

<p>The giant was making its way across a wide open grassland, moving steadily.  It was on its way from somewhere to somewhere else, perhaps migrating; this was one of the things the bio folks were studying.  Zeke moved in from the side, and opened up with a short burst from the Browning.  A crisp little display in our binoculars counted an even 20 rounds.  That would have dropped an elephant cold if there were any elephants left to aim it at.</p>

<p>The giant turned toward the source of its irritation.  Some of the bullets had very clearly bounced off of its mammoth beak.  It tilted its head in Zeke's direction; it was not quite smart enough to realize that something as small as Zeke and his flyer might be dangerous.</p>

<p>Zeke hit it again and the counter stopped at 80.  This time it saw the muzzle flash and understood that Zeke was the source of its irritation, and it moved toward him.  It moved toward him <em>very quickly</em>.  It was big but it had long legs and a surprisingly quick gait.</p>

<p>"Get out of there asshole," Emma said under her breath.</p>

<p>Zeke opened up again and this time the display ran to 160.  The giant had closed half the distance and Zeke had made no move to evade it.  The gun fired again and the display ran to 300; the flyer not being very large this was all the ammo he had.  The giant only ran faster and ripped loose a searing bellow of anger, like the DJ mix of a parrot imitating a foghorn dropped two octaves.</p>

<p>Zeke finally punched the controls and shot up vertically.  The monster bellowed up at him as he hovered about thirty meters beyond its reach.  Then it jumped.</p>

<p>Later the biologists marveled at the recordings.  Normally such a massive animal can't safely fall from more than a few meters, much less jump that high.  But its legs appeared to be equipped with a massive system of energy storage and shock absorbing accessories much more special-purpose than simple muscles.  It managed to knock Zeke aside with one claw but not get a grip on the sled, and fortunately didn't quite get in beak range.  It did snap its beak at him and Zeke said it sounded like two mountains slamming together.</p>

<p>The biologists followed in one of the observation platforms and saw that the ambush had apparently done no real damage.  Three days later the animal was still making its way south.  The biologists also found other targets of interest, but Zeke was intent on taking this one down.  Five days later he was ready with plan B.</p>

<p>"What the actual fuck is <em>that</em>?" I asked when I laid eyes on the new armament.  This gun was mounted fast to the sled so the sled would have to be maneuvered to aim it.  The gun itself was over two meters long.  Zeke no longer had a chair; he would lie face-down next to the gun strapped to the sled, which had been lengthened to about the size of a surfboard.</p>

<p>"<em>That</em> is a fucking Lahti L-39 anti-tank rifle," Emma said.  "Only semi-automatic, and not made since World War Two.  Somebody appears to have taken my advice."</p>

<p>"Yes I have," Zeke said from behind us.  "The fifty cal rounds just bounced off.  This is a much heavier shell with about the same muzzle velocity."</p>

<p>"Not fully auto though."</p>

<p>"I couldn't take enough ammo to fire for more than a few seconds if it was; I did have access to the full-auto aircraft variant.  No, this is for precision.  The whole sled will recoil hard when it's fired, and only the first shot full auto has any accuracy.  I have to find its weak points and drill them.  So that's why I got the not very Big Two laser sight mounted on the antique elephant gun."</p>

<p>"Why don't you use something more modern?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Because nothing like this has been made since we started using explosives for piercing armor."</p>

<p>"You could just use an RPG," Emma said sweetly.</p>

<p>"I'm hoping it doesn't come to that.  Messes up the barbecue."</p>

<p>"Surely a PDE5 inhibitor would work better than all this," I said after he left.</p>

<p>"Maybe they give him heartburn."</p>

<p>Round two started up just about like round one, except sixty kilometers further south.  Zeke still didn't sneak up from behind, although Emma confided that she would consider it the only sensible strategy after what had happened the first time.  Zeke settled in just above the grass and pulled the trigger.  Our round counters flipped to 1.</p>

<p>The animal made a gesture that was easily recognizable for "not this shit again."  It spotted Zeke and started toward him.  He fired at intervals of a few seconds, and on his fourth shot one of the giant's eyes exploded in a gout of red.  But it kept coming.</p>

<p>"These things don't seem to have gotten the <em>flight</em> part of the <em>fight or flight</em> memo," Emma observed.</p>

<p>"Zeke would just pursue it if it turned and ran.  Maybe it's smarter than it looks."</p>

<p>Red spots appeared on the animal's neck, on its chest, at its crotch.  There was audible groaning from the audience when that happened.  Still it came, and Zeke backed away, still firing, since the sled and gun were essentially one machine the way it was mounted.  Nothing slowed it down, and after exhausting his ammunition Zeke shot upward fast enough that it couldn't jump for him again.  On the comm channel we could hear him unleashing a blue streak of profanity at it.</p>

<p>That was, however, the end of the duel.  The biologists called eight hours later to let us know the animal had finally died of its wounds.  It had taken that long despite some obvious severed arteries that left it resting in a pool of at least a hundred liters of blood.  They got in quickly with robots to get the blood and tissue samples they needed; scavengers were gathering and many of those were also potentially too powerful to easily deal with.  Fortunately night was falling and the scavengers did seem to fear fire.  This made it possible for the biologists to move in when they were sure the monster was really dead and harvest Zeke's barbecue slab.</p>

<p>The tests were clean for human consumption and there was enough meat for everyone in the crew to have a generous sample.  At Zeke's personal direction they sliced the massive muscle into centimeter thick slices and then three centimeter wide strips.  Zeke turned out to be quite the barbecue artist.  But after all that drama it was rather anticlimatic to find out that the giant carnivore's meat tasted almost exactly like dark turkey meat.</p>

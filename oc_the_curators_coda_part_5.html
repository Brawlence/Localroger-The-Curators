<p>At the celebration I listened to stories of lost homeworlds and lives lived in a long succession of bioforms, something my own implant wouldn't allow me to do.  Finally I found my father and he told me the story of his life as a scientist billions of years ago, his lost aeons in the body of a derelict rover, and the team of humans who had awakened him, given him a Curator implant, and arranged for him to take a host.</p>

<p>"After my life as Helen I really wanted to try being human," he said, "and I had the knowledge to hide from their security measures.  But I was also aware that by choosing her new bioform in the way she did, Helen was doing the very thing that made humans feel so creepy about Curators taking human children as hosts, so when this bioform expires I won't do it again.  Andrew, on the other hand..."</p>

<p>"There's one more thing.  Your note mentioned a reward."</p>

<p>He smiled grandly.  "It did indeed, and you have certainly earned a reward.  In the past I understand our usual reward would have been to make you a Curator, giving you the freedom of immortality and personal galactic travel.  But of course humans have already arranged that for you."</p>

<p>"I guess you didn't know I'd be implanted when you left the note," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course I did.  I knew your mother's mind on the issue from our brief romantic encounter and it's almost unheard-of now to deny a human child implantation or the Cure.  Particularly in the culture of DENT worlds where everything is already artificial."</p>

<p>"Then what did you have in mind?"</p>

<p>"Well, we've also been known to give money or wealth or to use our powers to insert people into the structure of powers of their own race, but because of universal human implantation that wouldn't be very meaningful either.  You live in a post-scarcity society where you can have any reasonable thing you want, and a good measure of unreasonable things, and for that same reason the advantages of political power or social status are not as dramatic as they are in other cultures."</p>

<p>"So is there anything?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes there is.  And your surprise for today is that you've already received it.  I gave you an adventure.  You would be astonished at how few of your people will ever do the things you have done in the last few months."</p>

<p>"An adventure?"</p>

<p>"Of course!  You have traveled the galaxies in a Promethean fish bowl ship, and hand delivered one of the most rare and precious objects of art in the universe to its proper owner.  You have visited the home galaxy and alien worlds, and your species' homeworld Earth.  You were faced with puzzles and worked to solve them so you could make an important accomplishment.  And you proved you are a person of the kind of character who wouldn't just keep the amulet for yourself, which would have been awkward.  You are one of a handful of non-members who have ever visited this council, and you have earned our gratitude and respect."</p>

<p>"It didn't seem that special," I said.</p>

<p>"Of course I could have just told you in the note what was in the box and given you modern coordinates for where to bring it, but some of my companions would have been nervous about the existence of such a document.  I wanted to be very sure the Plasma and their sympathizers were done once and for all before exposing the amulet to the light of day, and I wanted to make sure nobody knew what it was for at least awhile when that happened.  And I wanted you to see that worlds exist apart from Va'arna with all sorts of interesting things to recommend them.  Your mother had never left Va'arna and I wanted to make sure you had a reason to do that at least once."</p>

<p>"Well thanks, I guess."  We drifted apart.</p>

<p>A bit later Andrew found me.  "So what's next for the hero of the day?"</p>

<p>"I don't feel much like a hero," I said.  "You did have to kidnap me."</p>

<p>"Once he realized you were on Earth showing the amulet around, your father asked me to intervene.  He didn't tell me who you were, just that the amulet was in play on Earth and that it needed to be protected and returned.  I believe he wanted you to have an adventure, not lose your bioform as a youngster."</p>

<p>"Thanks then."</p>

<p>"You know, there is a lot of opportunity for more adventure here in the Milky Way.  Earth is the oldest of our civilized worlds by a large margin, with many ancient things that exist nowhere else, and there are even far older and more interesting things on the other Curator-indexed worlds.  Every indexed world really needs a human ambassador and there is always a shortage, because we try to keep the population of Earth reasonable."</p>

<p>"Be an ambassador?  How?  I don't know anything."</p>

<p>He clapped me on the back.  "Oh, that's true for now," he said.  "But it won't be true for long, and the best way to make it not true is to put yourself in a situation where you have to learn."</p>

<p>"Like an adventure."</p>

<p>"A perfect beginning," he said with a big smile.</p>

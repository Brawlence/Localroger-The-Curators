<p><em>Earth Calendar Year 2970 CE</em></p>

<p><em>(615 years after the destruction of the Curators' Manufactory)</em></p>

<p>The Curators perhaps sensibly refrained from using planetary phenomena like days and years to mark time; instead they preferred the base frequency of the hydrogen maser at 1.42 gigahertz.  Their basic unit of time was 2<sup>32</sup> oscillations, a "tick" of about 3 seconds.</p>

<p>2<sup>16</sup> ticks gave a period of about 54 hours which we translate from Common as "day" even though it's about twice as long as the target day period of most Curated worlds.  2<sup>24</sup> ticks give a period of about 582 Earth days which we translate as "year," on the same logic.  2<sup>32</sup> ticks give a period of around 412 Earth years, which is represented by the same Galactic Common word we translate as "life."  It is actually just a bit more than the typical maximum lifespan of a Curated individual who has received the longevity boost but not the Cure.  And 2<sup>16</sup> lives, or 2<sup>48</sup> ticks are a unit of about 27 million Earth years, which we translate as "aeon."  It is a typical timeframe in which one might expect evolution to do something interesting.</p>

<p>The Universe itself is just about five hundred Curator aeons old, and the Curators themselves have been active for about three hundred of those aeons.  2<sup>8</sup> aeons give a time frame of nearly 7 billion years, which is a good approximation both of the length of the Curators' reign and the age of the Universe, depending on whether you round up or down.</p>

<p>But humans like seconds and minutes and days and years, and they like round base ten numbers of years so there was some excitement as we approached the year 3,000 according to Earth's current planetary calendar.  I was reminded of this because the operators of Gateway had installed a countdown clock.  Even though it had thirty years to run they were already getting ready.  The only living humans who could remember the year 2,000 CE were the six of us who had been recruited to be Curator observers tens of thousands of years ago.  Jay and Emma were born just after that celebration, and the next oldest living human was born in the twenty-second century.</p>

<p>My journey from the Pinwheel had been uneventful, but it was far from complete.  As I was leaving the galaxy ship <em>Super Catalyst</em> I received a discreet Curator to Curator microfold ping.  The negotiation was quick and I detoured from the receiving area to the Gateway Station's Curator reception lounge, which was provided as a staging area for those individuals who wanted to fold in using personal implants before continuing on to Earth.</p>

<p>The individual who met me was humanoid with dark leathery skin and no visible hair.  Like many Curators seeking to visit the Earth it paid homage to human modesty habits by wearing loose shorts and a baggy shirt top.</p>

<p>"I did not realize you were going to be on this transport," it said.  "It was my hope to meet you which drew me to visit Earth."</p>

<p>"Most of our kind come here for safety," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, that too.  I've avoided the worm so far but I'm sure I will catch it here."</p>

<p>"Yet you came?"</p>

<p>"If I catch it I will apply for asylum.  It is after all the likely ultimate fate of all our people.  Except I suppose for yourself."</p>

<p>It was not widely known that I had created the fold-following disease, or that I was personally immune to it, and I kind of wanted to keep it that way.  "How did you find that out?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It took a lot of research to figure out who to give this to," it said.  "I couldn't trust it to anybody else and I couldn't tell anybody <em>why</em> I needed to talk to someone I could trust that much."</p>

<p>"What is it you have for me?"</p>

<p>It reached into a pocket of its baggy shorts and produced a silver ball about four centimeters in diameter.  "A life and a half ago they used one of these to attack your world Terminus," it said.  "And there are at least two more of them out there."</p>

<hr>

<p>Of the Earth's current population of four hundred million, about three million are Curators; we believe this is a bit less than a third of their total galactic population, and it is the largest concentration of them in the galaxy by several orders of magnitude.  Ironically, Earth has become the safest place in the galaxy to be a Curator if your implant has contracted the fold-following disease.  Since they come in bioforms of every species in the galaxy, should you ever want to see a real-life version of the famous cantina scene in that classic film <em>Star Wars</em> just find an Earth bar frequented by exile Curators.</p>

<p>Shortly after Callie destroyed the Manufactory, the rulers of Earth very soberly decided to contract the construction of the most powerful fold defense system ever created.  While it was being built the spy minister who I had gifted with an amplifier helped the government to move an asteroid out beyond the inhibitor's thousand astronomical unit design range and they seeded it with DENT nanites to create Gateway station.  The fold inhibitor itself consisted of thirty-two nodes which used supergravity rather than orbiting to maintain their stations relative to the Sun out beyond the orbit of Neptune.</p>

<p>The inhibitor is tuned to allow microfold operations so energy collection, communication, remote sensing, gravity plating and supergravity sublight transport all work normally within its field.  You could even build and operate a Sunlight Cannon.  But it does not allow any matter-carrying fold of any aperture or any range, at all.  So if you wish to visit Earth you must fold to the perimeter of the field and make your way to the inner system in normal space, presumably using supergravity.</p>

<p>If your ship can acelerate at one Earth gravity continuously give or take, which is typical of Promethean multiplex drives, it will take you about three months to reach Earth.  If you're in more of a hurry, you fold to Gateway and wait for one of the four regular super picket ferries, which are converted great ships of the Pinwheel diaspora.  These ships use the sun's full surface gravity to accelerate at about 27 gees, and they make the route between Gateway and Earth in a little over two weeks.  </p>

<p>If you're in a bigger hurry than that there is another option.  There are private services that use smaller ships which can tap the gravity of the Sagittarius A* black hole and push two hundred gees.  These can reach the inner system in a little more than a week Earth time, and a little less than a week ship time because they are going over 90 percent of the speed of light at turnaround.</p>

<p>So all this creates a buffer between Earth and the rest of the galaxy.  News and communication are instantaneous via the microfold, but if you want to actually travel to or from the Earth it takes a commitment.</p>

<p>The real reason the inhibitor was built is an original calculation that if someone were to pull Callie's neutron star corium ball stunt against the Earth, from the edge of the inhibitor field it would limit the radiation flux to something that normal matter can withstand and provide sixty hours of warning to erect defenses as the radiation shell approached Earth.  Such a large radius wouldn't have been necessary for the very old neutron star Callie tapped to destroy the Manufactory, but Earth is in practical fold range of the Crab Nebula and its very young most likely trillion degree Kelvin pulsar.</p>

<p>But the inhibitor has had other unanticipated consequences.  If you are a Curator whose implant has contracted the fold-following disease I created, you are still a Curator; you can fold yourself, your personality is backed up, and you still have the use of all the resources your implant provides.</p>

<p>But the greatest danger to you is now from <em>other Curators</em> who can walk up behind you, put their hand on your shoulder, and fold your bioform off to some inhospitable place like Antarctica or the Moon while your implant drifts off into the vastness of the galaxy.  Your implant won't go into emulation because it isn't in the right mode, and even if your bioform somehow survives you will be a shadow of your former self, unable to fold or take another host and lacking even many of your memories if you're very old.  A large fraction of the early victims who simply didn't know to avoid fold ships killed themselves rather than live on as mortals.</p>

<p>But this isn't a problem on Earth.  On Earth nobody can fold you off to oblivion by surprise.  You also can't fold <em>yourself</em> anywhere but when you're used to the idea of being immortal and unkillable, that can seem like a relatively minor inconvenience.</p>

<hr>

<p>"How did you get this?" I asked the Curator as it handed me the sphere.</p>

<p>"I was an apprentice to one of the leaders of the Plasma.  She spoke of meeting you when you joined the organization.  There were about ten of us on ... an indexed world.  We escaped the fold following disease because the leaders don't -- didn't keep a constant presence on the asteroid stations."</p>

<p>"You stole it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I was never content with the Plasma's hatred of humans.  I joined them because I felt compelled by the words of the Pessimist.  At first I didn't take their hatred of humans all that seriously but then my teacher told me of the test to be conducted at Terminus and the plan that would be set in motion if it worked.  I felt this was a horrible perversion of the Pessimist's message but I was deep into the process of proving myself to the organization and I didn't dare voice an objection."</p>

<p>"What happened after the Manufactory was destroyed?"</p>

<p>"It took a month or so for them to figure out what had happened.  She railed about vengeance and all kinds of nonsense, and then she learned of the fold-following disease and she raged over that.  It was while she was insensible over those things that I stole the solar bomb.  Then a few days later she just disappeared.  I knew that she would soon find out that the box she had taken with her no longer contained its lethal jewel and so I left that world myself."</p>

<p>"I have been in touch with the apprentices and assistants of some of the other leaders and it seems they all left at the same time, none of them with any of their assistants or lieutenants.  We don't know where they went.  There are far more worlds in this galaxy which are livable than there are which are indexed and occupied by a sapient species.  And at least two of those leaders also had prototype solar bombs which they showed to their students."</p>

<p>"So why have you come forth now?"</p>

<p>It bowed its head.  "She found me.  I have been in hiding but I did not realize what effort they would place into finding their lost death jewel.  Fortunately none of them had the fold following disease or they could have simply infected me, and I get the impression they are loath to risk interaction with those that may have been infected so recruiting someone to infect me was not an option.  Fortunately I had hidden it well and after a few local planetary years I was able to sneak back and retrieve it.  But they still have spies there and they will find out I returned.  They will easily guess why."</p>

<p>"If you go to Earth you will certainly get the fold-following disease."</p>

<p>"I am at peace with that.  I knew what they were planning against your people and I did nothing because I wanted to belong to their group.  I did not realize just what the bomb would do to an inhabited world until they bragged of their success.  I have been ill with guilt ever since.  At least on Earth I will be safe even with the disease."</p>

<p>While it was making this confession I quietly went into its implant's diagnostic menu and changed the pass code into the function block that allowed fold following to be disabled.  When the worm tried to infect it, it would gain no access and assume that a previous instance of itself had gotten there first.  That is how Jay, Emma, Veronica, and I remain uninfected.  By the time it realized it was immune it would have no idea exactly why.</p>

<p>It was the least I could do in exchange for the knowledge and the artifact it had given me.</p>

<p>It turned out we were the only Curators aboard the ferry, so we met often for drinks at the bar and to exchange stories.  It gave me much more useful intelligence about the habits of its mistress before her departure.  I felt it was imperative to follow up on the fate of the Plasma leadership, because if there was any force in the galaxy which really justified the paranoid defences we had erected around Earth, it was them.</p>

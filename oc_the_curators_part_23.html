<p>The Director caught us as we were moving our stuff from <em>Trinity</em> to the <em>Horse Pill</em> to do a little scouting for new colony world candidates.  <em>Horse Pill</em> looked exactly like what it was named after, a huge gel cap about seven meters long and three in diameter.  It was a generous accommodation for a two-person scouting crew and our instruments, and much quieter and really less conspicuous than <em>Grasshopper</em>, which was being fitted to hang from the roof of the Smithsonian Air and Space museum.</p>

<p>Fold drives being a rather valuable commodity, <em>Grasshopper</em>'s had found its way into the <em>Horse Pill</em>.</p>

<p>"You guys might want to make a detour," the Director said as he waved a tablet at us.  "We've gotten a rather interesting message.  An invitation from a new race, but directed specifically at you two.  And they want you to visit rather than them coming here."</p>

<p>M scanned the tablet as I asked, "Are we sure it's legit?"</p>

<p>"Checks out with several other mature races on the CI.  It's from their current royal leader, so it would be good diplomacy to pay our respects."</p>

<p>"On it," we said together as M handed the tablet back.</p>

<p>"They named their own world in English?" I asked as we loaded the <em>Horse Pill</em>.</p>

<p>"Yes, they call it <em>Hyacinth</em>.  Isn't that an Earth flower?"</p>

<p>"This is going to be different."</p>

<p>We had Hyacinth's Curator Index and therefore its current location and other useful data.  With the supergravity drive and such a small ship we were in contact with Hyacinth ground control within forty-five minutes.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, is the controller speaking English?  This isn't a translator?"</p>

<p>"No, not on our end and I don't think on theirs either."</p>

<p>Our approach took us in low over a large city.  In the center of town was something I'd never seen on an alien world, a tall shaft-like building towering over the rest of the city.  "That's impressive," I said as we approached.</p>

<p>"They want us to notice it," M said.  "Our instructions are to land on its roof."</p>

<p>Before we dropped the hatch we could see our greeting party through the nose dome, a group of four bright blue feathered bipedal aliens.  They had large curved beaks instead of lips, and their Mark of the Curators was a bow-tie of yellow feathers just below the collar.  One of them wore some kind of decorative body harness.</p>

<p>We exited our craft and the leader with the harness offered a handshake.  "Welcome to Hyacinth," he said in an oddly whistly version of English.  "You may also refer to our race as the Hyacinth, and to myself as Ascendant Prince Henry."</p>

<p>"It must have taken some effort for you to learn our language," I said with what I hoped was a tone of respect.  I couldn't figure out how he was speaking English without lips.</p>

<p>"And well worth it if it leads to the diplomatic result I hope for.  Unless I am terribly mistaken I believe you are human pilot M, slayer of fold ships, and human diplomat J, tamer of raiders.  It is an honor to welcome you to our world.  If you would accompany us, I would like to show you a few things, and our technology for making a presentation isn't as portable as yours."</p>

<p>The elevator was typical alien tech, floating on repulsor plates to go up or down and locking in place with mechanical clips to access a destination floor.  Earth elevator companies were already making plans to switch over and get rid of all the damn cables.</p>

<p>"How should we properly refer to you?"</p>

<p>"A proper question for a diplomat, human J.  You can call me Prince Henry.  We suggest you just use male pronouns to refer to all of us, since our genitalia are internal and we have neither primary nor secondary external sexual characteristics; most of our young people don't know what sex they are until they have a good reason to wonder."</p>

<p>"That must be... interesting.  How <em>do</em> your people learn their sex?"</p>

<p>"Well, laying an egg is a major clue."  This drew a clucking which we would learn was the Hyacinth natural form of laughter from the others.  "Also being in a committed relationship with someone who lays a fertile egg is a clue.  And for the impatient, there are always tomographic medical scans.  But we really don't consider it that important unless we're actively trying to reproduce."</p>

<p>He motioned for us to take seats at a semicircular table facing a display screen.  "So how do you like our building?  I intend to make it the seat of our government once I ascend to the throne.  As Ascendant Prince I am afforded much authority but not quite that much.  With the notable exception of the wonders of your own Earth, we are fairly certain this is now the tallest building in the galaxy."</p>

<p>"I was told such structures were impossible with your nanite tech."</p>

<p>"And so they were until we learned a wonderful thing from you.  This building is made of nanite matrix reinforced with glass fibers.  We had to learn to make the fibers, since the nanites can't, and to teach the nanites to arrange and position them and then to bond to them as they built up matrix.  We are still refining the technique but it is going to revolutionize a few things."</p>

<p>"How do you make the fibers?"</p>

<p>"We sent you several pallets of gravity plating in payment for basic machine tools and foundation hardware.  Of course we could have just bought a fiberglass spinning machine, but we wanted the ability to make as many of our own as we might want, since we are thinking we might be wanting a lot of them before long."</p>

<p>"I've heard this 'we' from leaders before," I said a bit skeptically.  "Do your people share this vision?"</p>

<p>"Why do you think I built this building?"</p>

<p>"What provoked such an interest in us?  We've met dozens of species who mostly don't care what we've done, and one that got real pissed off about it."</p>

<p>"Unfortunate, that.  A couple of years ago you provided transport for the royal guests to ... well, I can't pronounce that place's name either, but you'll remember it.  Eight worlds in less than a day, in your ship <em>Trinity</em>.  I was one of your passengers, and I was enthralled.  Most people don't seem to care that they might be living in the midst of history being made, and others react like the Sevillians with terror.  Maybe it's because I am young, but I see your emergence among us as an opportunity.  I do not want to be the leader who let such an opportunity pass, and I want my people to benefit from the wonders that are likely to emerge."</p>

<p>"Your message indicated that you might have some particular wonder in mind."</p>

<p>"I do.  But first, I have a couple of questions which concern your supergravity drive.  I realize your fold drive is not for sale because you are using your own full production, and honestly I think that is the best use for those drives because none of us has the other arts ready to make such small and nimble ships.  But I am hoping that the supergravity drive is simpler and that you might be willing to part with one or two of them for a suitable return.  And I also need to know how far the supergravity field can be extended from the drive itself; I am hoping for at least a kilometer, preferably at least two."</p>

<p>I turned to M, since she's the technical expert.  "On the first point we can make a lot more supergravity drives, because they don't need very accurate tuning to create a graviton flux.  They are physically smaller and simpler and we complete them faster and get a better yield than we do with the fold drives.  But we also have more use for them, since they form a basis for exploiting our solar system's extraterrestrial resources.  We can use a supergravity-only ship for in-system exploration and transport.  But the bottom line is that yes, we can make a lot more of them, so with a sufficient motive we could probably break a few loose for alternate purposes.  On the second point, we've been locking them down since we don't want unsupervised people dragging asteroids around without authorization, but yes the field can be made several kilometers in radius."</p>

<p>Prince Henry nodded at one of his companions and an image appeared on the screen.  "This is my vision," he said.  "A nanite based fold ship.  A bit on the small side by our standards, this concept vehicle has a pressure dodecahedron inscribing a sphere one point three kilometers in diameter.  It also has an unpressurized skirt creating a ten-sided support pad with multiple gravity plated cargo levels.  It is fiberglass reinforced, and therefore less than a third the mass of typical similar sized ships, an important feature because it has to be able to support its own weight in a gravity field.  Because a supergravity drive will make it possible for this ship to land on the surface of a world."</p>

<p>The picture became animated and showed this, the ship touching down on a prepared landing area that would have to be a mile wide.  "Loading and unloading such a ship would still be time consuming compared to what your small ships manage, but much faster and simpler than it would be via shuttles to orbit.  And we could manage large population transfers and cargos that are far beyond your capacity."</p>

<p>M and I sucked in our breath at the same time.  "That's an impressive vision," I said.</p>

<p>"And totally dependent on your help.  It is absolutely unworkable without your supergravity drive, which we have proven cannot be duplicated with the nanites available to us.  It will be thirteen Earth months before I ascend to the throne, but I can make plans.  I want this to be the first great project of my reign."</p>

<p>"What would you be offering us for our supergravity drive?"</p>

<p>"I would actually be asking for more than just the drive.  If the concept proves out, I will be building a coalition of worlds to make a manufacturing center to use your techniques to make supergravity drives for ourselves.  I would ask for your help in that endeavour.  You have said to others that you do not wish to hide your technology.  We do not see any current added value in trying to duplicate your fold drive, but this is something for which I think we can make a case."</p>

<p>"That sounds reasonable, but you still haven't told us what's in it for us."</p>

<p>"We won't just build one prototype ship.  We will build two."  The image on the projector split so that it showed two landed mountain-sized foldships.  "And in exchange for your help, we will give the second one to the humans of Earth to use as you wish."</p>

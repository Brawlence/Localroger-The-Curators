<p>From the Top of the Mark Helen and I admired the San Francisco skyline.  It wasn't what it had always been.  The Golden Gate and Coit Tower were still there, but I also remembered the pyramidal skyscraper which had unfortunately fallen a few hundred years after it was built.  It wasn't a very good place for tall buildings, but the Mark Hopkins had been well reinforced and carefully preserved.  As it had been when it was built, it was now once again the highest and most luxurious point from which to observe the city and the bay.</p>

<p>I had warned Helen about the power of strong alcoholic drink but if she was old enough to fold herself across the galaxy, which she was, she was also old enough to deal with that.  I warned her that it would be tempting to drink her chocolate martini far too fast, and her first sip was careful and tentative.</p>

<p>I handed her the glass rod which tethered her to me.  "I have no basis to keep this from you any longer," I said.  "There are more things I'd like to show you, but it is no longer appropriate for me to keep you on a leash."</p>

<p>"What do I do with this, stir my martini?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, that's what the straw is for.  You break the novitiate rod."</p>

<p>She struck it against the edge of the table and it dissolved into dust.</p>

<p>"What has been destroyed today can never be reassembled," I said.  "You are no longer a novice.  You are now a Curator.  Behold our galactic garden, and take your place among us as one of its stewards."</p>

<p>"I don't want to <em>be</em> a Curator," Helen said.</p>

<p>"I know, that's just the ritual speech.  You are now a free and independent being with the same powers the rest of us have.  They are guilty of a lot of perverse shit but the Curators did make these implants to be completely independent of external control."</p>

<p>"I want to destroy them."</p>

<p>"There are some people here you should probably meet first.  Even if destroying them was a good idea -- and I'm not suggesting either that it is or isn't -- it won't be easy, because they are independent beings with the same powers you have and a lot more experience using them.  And there are more things you should probably know before you embark on your quest."</p>

<p>"But you're not going to try to stop me?"</p>

<p>"I just made it impossible for me to stop you.  That is what it means to become a Curator."</p>

<p>"Thanks, I think," she said.  And she took another sip of her martini.</p>

<hr />

<p>Callie accepted Helen's slide show of the Ancestors' home quietly.  Such microfold communications were one of the few things her human-made implant could still usefully do within Earth's inhibitor field.  "It's beautiful," she said when Helen was done.  "I understand it was destroyed in that ancient fold war."</p>

<p>"Thats what I've been told," Helen said.</p>

<p>"I guess they at least knew what they were destroying.  I didn't, really."</p>

<p>"What did you think you were destroying?" Helen asked warily.</p>

<p>"There was a planet orbiting the neutron star, and someone had turned that world into a massive nanoassembly complex.  I only got a distant glimpse of it but I think it consisted of millions of assembly stations in orbit being supplied with raw materials from the planet and possibly energy from the neutron star.  They were using it to make fold-based weapons to attack the Pinwheel colonies, with a goal of destroying all our colony worlds at the same time.  I destroyed the manufactory in order to stop that."</p>

<p>"You folded it into a neutron star?"</p>

<p>"No, our fold drives are carefully built to make that impossible, and that kind of attack might not have taken out the assembly stations anyway.  I folded a fold-ship-sized bit of the neutron star into the core of the planet.  It contained enough energy to obliterate everything."</p>

<p>"Like the way they attacked Terminus," Helen said.</p>

<p>"Yes, that gave me both the idea and the motivation to use it."</p>

<p>"Do you feel bad about doing it?"</p>

<p>"I always wonder just what it was I destroyed.  It's clear I was right that it was the manufactory, and it stopped the Plasma attack on our colonies.  But it also stopped all the Curators' production of everything else.  And I don't know what was there to make such production possible.  I don't know what we might have learned from alliance and study."</p>

<p>"But they were using it to try to destroy you."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You're right, it's very hard to know how I should feel about all this."</p>

<p>"You should feel like you are at war," Callie said.  "Because whether you realize it or not, you are.  The ancestors of those who run the galaxy today, and who arranged to run it unchallenged for seven billion years, started off their reign by destroying dozens of worlds including your original home.  If you are threatened with a weapon so obscene it should never have been used, is it right to use that very weapon to save yourself?  Sometimes in war that is the only way you can survive."</p>

<p>"My current people the Prometheans have never had a war.  But my Ancestor's people did.  I think they knew this."</p>

<p>"At the time the fold war happened everyone would probably have been of the same species.  Your Ancestor's race, colonizing this galaxy.  The ones who destroyed your home may have felt the same measure of threat as if they were being overrun by an opposing wave of expansion their philosophy could never allow them to match."</p>

<p>"Surely being 'overrun' by people you disagree with doesn't justify genocide."</p>

<p>"Most of us would agree with you.  But you will meet those who don't."</p>

<p>Helen thought about this for several moments, then said: "That would be unfortunate."</p>

<hr />

<p>"I'm carrying your implant?" Helen asked Veronica incredulously.</p>

<p>"It's not my implant any more," Veronica said.  "I volunteered it so that your Ancestor could tell us about his home."</p>

<p>"I can't show you what he remembers if you don't have an implant to send the memories to," Helen said.</p>

<p>"You already have.  I've seen your drawings and sculptures.  It must have been an exciting place."</p>

<p>"My Promethean family don't think of that as a good thing."</p>

<p>"In some ways it isn't.  You can't have excitement without danger, or at least the clever facsimile of danger.  Do you know that humans build machines designed to scare the crap out of us and we pay good money to ride them for a few minutes?"</p>

<p>"We had such amusements on the Ancestors' world.  I remember helping to design one to simulate the experience of a disaster in space."</p>

<p>"This is new," I said.</p>

<p>"So far I've mostly remembered things that were real.  I remember thinking that entertainments were kind of frivolous when there was real space to explore."</p>

<p>"In some ways your entertainments tell us more about your society than your real accomplishments.  They tell us what you want and fear."</p>

<p>"As <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> informed the Prometheans," Helen said.</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"What did you do?  How did you get an implant in the first place, and why would you donate it to me?"</p>

<p>Veronica looked at me and I nodded.</p>

<p>"I am a spy," she said.</p>

<p>"You uncover secrets?  We had people who did that," Helen said.</p>

<p>"<em>Uncover</em> is a very gentle word for what I do.  Sometimes the people who are keeping secrets work very hard to keep them, and getting those secrets requires violence."</p>

<p>"Because you are at war."</p>

<p>"We are often at war even when few people realize we are.  Spies are always at war, as long as there are secrets to penetrate."</p>

<p>"How do you do it?"</p>

<p>"Usually I just pretend to be someone I'm not.  The other stuff comes into play when that fails.  Andrew learned the craft from me as we sought a very bad Curator who had come to Earth to play at being a murderer.  Later I helped him to find another Curator who was trying to use a fold device to destroy the Earth, and rather than let that being's implant return to the Curators he gave it to me."</p>

<p>Helen turned to me.  "How did you take a Curator's implant?"</p>

<p>"Long story, but I know some service pass codes most Curators have forgotten exist."</p>

<p>"Really," Helen said thoughtfully.</p>

<hr />

<p>"I'm staying with Veronica for awhile.  She has agreed to teach me more of her spycraft."</p>

<p>"And why would she do that?" I said, looking at Veronica.</p>

<p>"You know you are looking for certain secrets yourself.  Nobody will ever trust another Curator with a human bioform looking into them."  She nodded at Helen.  "But a Promethean is another matter."</p>

<p>"Do you think she's ready?"</p>

<p>"She won't ever be ready if she doesn't start learning.  And she has an implant.  It didn't take you very long to get up to speed when we were hunting Nemesis."</p>

<p>"There will be a limit to what you can teach her under the influence of the inhibitor."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, that will force her to focus on what is most important."  She looked at Helen.  "The people you're going after have all the skills you do.  But if you reach the point of folding out to save yourself, or of spooking your quarry so that they fold out to save themselves, that will mean you have probably failed in your mission."</p>

<p>"Well, nobody comes to Earth for just a few days and I have some business I can be taking care of in Atlanta.  Is there anything I can do before I go?"</p>

<p>"Show her the prototype fold weapon she'll be looking for," Veronica said.  So I held up my hand, and showed Helen my meeting with the Curator who had donated it and our subsequent tests.</p>

<p>Then I went to Atlanta and waited.</p>

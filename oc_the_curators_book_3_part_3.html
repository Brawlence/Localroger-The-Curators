<p><em>Ten Years Later</em></p>

<p>It had been less than thirty years, the blink of an eye really, before I found myself
visiting Earth again after thinking I might never do that in all my remaining life.</p>

<p>I came to Earth in the usual way aboard the intergalactic shuttle <em>Palomino</em>.  The
fact that it was shuttling in from another galaxy was not widely known.  What <em>was</em> 
widely known was only that Earth was a stop on its regular orbit, a feature it had in
common with hundreds of other fold ships.  I masked my entry by folding myself to 
another great fold ship before we were in range for the agency to reliably track me,
and taking the ground shuttle down from there.</p>

<p>Then after a couple of days in New York City I folded to Denver without bothering
to disguise what I was doing at all, and took up a seat at a coffee shop near my
former companion agent's condo where we had often met for breakfast.  I made sure
to sit within the field of view of a publicly networked surveillance camera and spent
long hours reading the classics of Asimov, Clarke, and Heinlein.  Finally around noon
of the third day of my vigil she showed up.</p>

<p>"I can't say I ever expected to see <em>you</em> again," she said from behind me.</p>

<p>"Your people are slipping.  I've been waiting for you for days."  I turned around
and there she was, dressed in her leather trench coat and mirrorshades just like 
the day I met her.</p>

<p>"Oh, we've known you were here.  You couldn't have made it plainer if you'd posted
a notice on the microfold announcement board.  We recognized your signature and we
know you're still dragging the amplifier around.  It just took my superiors some
time to figure out what the hell to do about it."</p>

<p>"It took them three days to figure out the most obvious thing?"</p>

<p>She sat down and signaled the waiter for a coffee.  "It took three days to realize
all the other options were dead end stupid, and that I didn't believe you would kill
me."</p>

<p>"Yes, a lot of people would have been bent out of shape about the second MPTP injector."</p>

<p>"I kind of thought that was the reason you ghosted us.  How did you find out about it?"</p>

<p>"I can sense my target environment finely enough to position myself within millimeters 
on a fold to a planet light-years away.  Did you really think you could hide something 
from me under your clothing?"</p>

<p>"When you put it that way, it was kind of a stupid idea.  If it's any consolation it
wasn't <em>my</em> stupid idea and I hadn't been ordered to use it, only to have it on hand in
case I got another order."</p>

<p>"And if you had gotten that order?"</p>

<p>"Look, you have the advantage of setting your own course.  I am a tool.  The people who
made me what I am made me to be useful to them, and I'm not useful to them if I second
guess their decisions and orders.  I didn't like it and I told them that, but I won't 
lie and say I would have disobeyed them if they told me to bring you in anyway."</p>

<p>"I understand.  I have been that way myself for much longer than you can possibly 
imagine, and sixty thousand years of that as a human being in this body.  Becoming
independent has been quite a change."</p>

<p>"If you knew what I might have done, why did you come back?"</p>

<p>"I'm biochemically immune to MPTP now, and I also have several software bypasses programmed
into my implant just in case."</p>

<p>"Of course.  I advised them that trying that again would be extra stupid if it matters."</p>

<p>"It doesn't really.  I came prepared but I also came bearing gifts.  Will you fold with me?"
and I extended my hand.</p>

<p>She took my hand, and a moment later we were in a cargo hold of the <em>Palomino</em>.
Thirty-five small crates were labeled <strong>Earth per Andrew</strong>.</p>

<p>"Andrew?  You have a name now?"</p>

<p>"You should try it sometime."</p>

<p>"You should know it's unworkable for people like us -- or at least people like you were.
Our mystics once taught that names were a source of power, and that knowing the name
of a person or thing gave one power over it.  In the modern world that is literally true."</p>

<p>"I knew some of the first people who believed that," I said.  "And they weren't completely
wrong.  But they were also being a lot more paranoid than they needed to be in their
immediate environment.  The forces they were afraid of in those original days
did not exist, and the ones worth worrying about wouldn't be invented for millennia."</p>

<p>"So why Andrew?"</p>

<p>"Andrew Martin.  A fictional character who became human.  From Asimov."</p>

<p>"Appropriate.  What's in the crates?"</p>

<p>"Survival."  I popped the top so she could gaze in to one of them.</p>

<p>"A fold drive?"</p>

<p>"No, an element of a planetary defense system.  One that can prevent even an amplifier from 
folding a planet into its sun.  That's really the only weapon the Curators have."</p>

<p>"These things can defeat an amplifier?"</p>

<p>"Just as we found your inferior detectors became quite powerful when organized into a
global network, these make use of the same principle in the other direction.  I've 
tested them against my own actual amplifier.  They are effective."</p>

<p>"You risked folding yourself into a sun?"</p>

<p>"I risked folding a dead world into its sun.  Unlike an implant, the amplifier is capable of 
a limited degree of remote control.  The amplifier would have gone with the planet, but it only
contacts our world through a dimensionless point of space-time.  Even the radiation from the
center of a sun would not affect it, and it would have simply returned to me for further 
instruction.  But it reported failure at its full strength, which is probably stronger than
most of theirs because I have learned some configuration tricks they have mostly forgotten."</p>

<p>"How do we install them?"</p>

<p>"You just give the command.  But for that you need the C-in-C provision."  I opened one of the
three oddball boxes which contained larger spheres.  "That would be these."  I gave it a
microfold command and it levitated out of the box.  I directed the agent to hold it.  She
placed her hands on it, and I issued another microfold command.  It began to shrink, quickly
disappearing into an invisible point.</p>

<p>"What the hell was <em>that</em>?"</p>

<p>"That is an implant.  Curator style, but built by humans.  It's much more primitive than the
Curator version but still rather useful.  It doesn't back up your consciousness and while it
can fold you it only has a range of a few astronomical units.  More usefully it can 
produce microfold commands compatible with our other kit, including the planetary defense system."</p>

<p>"It's in my <em>body</em>?"</p>

<p>"The point of contact will settle in your thalamus, but it will wander around a bit first
learning how to communicate with your brain.  When it has learned enough it will begin to
teach you.  We've built hundreds of these things and have gotten pretty good at that part."</p>

<p>"Hundreds of them?  How do you make them?"</p>

<p>"Bulk nanoassembly, of course.  Same as the planetary defense nodes."</p>

<p>"You've made that work in just twenty years?"</p>

<p>"We were already working on it for twenty years at Terra Nova before we evacuated.  Which we
did because we were afraid the Curators' interest in Nemesis' death might lead them to find
out what we were <em>really</em> doing there."</p>

<p>"And just what <em>were</em> you doing?"</p>

<p>"Seeking to duplicate all of the Curators' technology.  We still couldn't beat them in a 
flat out conflict but we've made a lot of progress.  Our current aim is to get these defense 
nodes around every world with a significant human population before the Curators realize what
is going on."</p>

<p>"I can't take that responsibility.  This needs to go to my superiors."</p>

<p>"That's why there are three control implants.  I assume one of the others will go to someone in authority and one to someone who will do a detailed research evaluation."</p>

<p>"And I get one."</p>

<p>"Yes.  It can't take you to another star but it will make it almost impossible to restrain
or imprison you, and while you'll be a bit more vulnerable than I am it will also be very 
hard to kill you once your senses are dialed in."</p>

<p>"And why me?"</p>

<p>"I was hard for me to think of anyone on this world who could put it to better use."</p>

<p>"Don't we need to ship these to Earth?"</p>

<p>"Just the other two implants.  As long as you give the instruction before the <em>Palomino</em> departs
you can just tell the nodes to self-deploy and they will do so.  They will also become dimensionless
points in our space-time so nobody is likely to trip over them on the surface of the Earth.
And you will have access to full system status reports through your implant."</p>

<p>"Bulk nanoassembly and implants," she said.  "Nobody has any idea that humans have done such 
things."</p>

<p>"And that's a good thing," I said.  "One of the reasons I chose you and your agency was that I 
know you know the value of a secret well kept, and this one is <em>very</em> important.  When the Curators
realize what we are trying to do and that we might succeed they will move with every power at their
disposal to destroy us all.  In all their history they have never faced a credible existential
threat and the only way they know to react to one is to snuff it out before it becomes actual.
Diplomacy with potential equals is not a thing they have on their resume."</p>

<p>Three days later I found myself explaining this to the other people I'd worked with to kill
Nemesis.  They were not used to dealing with people who live outside of their own control 
structures and obviously regarded my story skeptically.  But my agent verified everything.</p>

<p>"So what's it like having this implant?" the agency head asked her.</p>

<p>"It speaks in my ear and shows me things, so far mostly wireframe diagrams superimposed on my visual
field.  It still seems to be learning how to project more detailed sensory impressions and take
finer commands.  I did successfully fold from one room of my flat to another, but my clothes
didn't make the trip with me."</p>

<p>"That always happens to beginners," I said.  "Our user interface isn't as polished as the 
Curators' and marking off the items you want to take with you on a fold is a nontrivial skill."</p>

<p>"It sounds like we only need this defense because of the danger <em>you</em> might pose to the Curators,"
the research director said darkly.</p>

<p>"The Curators will be coming," I said.  "Project or no project.  Our very existence outside of 
their guided Curation, inventing things that are unknown to other races, is an affront to an 
order they have maintained for aeons.  Remember that I have been a Curator for over a million
Earth years, and I am considered young by their standards.  If we inspire another race to 
radically change their behavior it may be a tipping point, and the whole galaxy is aware of us and
watching because of the Promethean fold drive plans.  One of your leaders once said it is not in
our nature to sit contentedly in second place, and there's a good reason for that."</p>

<p>"This is a great power for us to assume without any kind of due process," the agency head said.</p>

<p>"Once the network is deployed, all it really amounts to is awareness.  You will know the status
of what needs to be a secret system anyway, and more importantly the three of you will know
if it has been attacked."</p>

<p>"And what do we do then?"</p>

<p>"There will be all sorts of possibilities, since you will still be alive.  I think that might
be a cue that the secrecy is no longer beneficial."</p>

<p>With that the agency head and research director took their implants, and after another couple
of days for them to learn to understand the telemetry we deployed the defense network.  They
agreed to discreetly place or recruit appropriate recipients for the CiC implants on the other
Milky Way colony worlds.</p>

<p>There was a marked difference between Sofia and the agent in bed.  Sofia preferred to lose
herself in the intensity of her feelings, as if joining some primal current that could only
be found in a river of passion.  For the agent pleasure was another tool, one she used to
control her own body as well as her partner's.  On the morning before the Palomino was 
to depart, she asked "Where are you really going?"</p>

<p>"Far away," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, but how far?  Andromeda far?"</p>

<p>"At least," I said.</p>

<p>"Will you forget about us out there?"</p>

<p>"I think the fact that I'm here now would answer that."</p>

<p>She looked at me for a long moment, and said "Veronica."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"My name until the agency took me in and erased it was Veronica."</p>

<p>"I won't ever forget that... Veronica."</p>

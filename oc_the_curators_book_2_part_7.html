<p><em>Twenty-five years later</em></p>

<p>Quentin carefully followed the directions for approach to CI:524288, whose multiracial residents had nicknamed <em>19-bits</em> for its Curator's Index as represented in binary.  19-bits was one of the busier spaceports in the galaxy, as the home of three separate independent and competing Promethean style fold drive shops.  Although the <em>Implausible Alibi</em> was unique among fold ships Quentin didn't bother trying to conceal it when he landed.  Landable fold ships now came in a dizzying variety of shapes and construction techniques and being so small, the <em>Alibi</em> was usually taken for an in-system supergravity transport on casual glance.</p>

<p>Each of the drive yards was a sprawling complex of low-rise nanite structures.  Dirty processes were done in the buildings toward the back and clean ones up front closer to the trade area where travelers gathered to haggle over purchase opportunities.  About once every three months each yard produced a drive, which was demonstrated on a stand in the trade building for potential buyers to test and inspect.</p>

<p>Promethean drives were hand crafted from modules that could be made from nanite-made and relatively low tech non-nanite source materials, and the modules could be tested and rejected if necessary before being permanently installed on a new drive.  They were larger than human drives by about an order of magnitude but far easier to make, not requiring the kind of planetary effort mankind had needed to put into manufacturing infrastructure.  With the Promethean instructions in hand, any group of a few hundred individuals that cared to put in a modest effort could set up a shop to build them.  </p>

<p>And while they weren't equal to human drives, they were much smaller and performed much better than traditional nanite-based drives.  They could produce supergravity to land and were practical for a shipyard to handle in a planetary gravity field.  And they held a better level of calibration for accurately making longer range folds.</p>

<p>There were now dozens of drive shops across the galaxy making them.  They were still inferior to human drives, which were coveted by those races that wanted to make the longest journeys with a minimum of hops, but human drives were also much more rare and expensive.  Unlike human drives, most Promethean drives were made by aliens who had never been anywhere near Prometheus or ever met a Promethean.</p>

<p>The Hyacinth Consortium which had formed to use human techniques to make supergravity drives for retrofitting nanite-based ships ceased operation and basically gave the whole operation and the planet it was based on to the humans, who were refitting those facilities to make more fold drives.</p>

<p>If you wanted a human built drive you created an account with the Bank of Earth and seeded it with credits traded for valuables like refined raw materials.  Humans had depleted many of the Earth's mineral reserves in our era of explosive technological growth.  We had also developed a taste for exotic foodstuffs, liquors, and other commodities which were made elsewhere in the galaxy.</p>

<p>If you wanted a Promethean drive and didn't have the instructions or want to put in the effort to make it yourself you showed up at a world with a drive shop with barter to trade.  The bidding was fierce but tended to slow down at a rather small fraction of what you would need to get a human made drive.  With three drive shops, 19-bits offered multiple opportunities for a bidder to succeed.  It was typical for a buyer's representative to spend years before winning an auction, and rather than wait around most drive traders traveled a circuit with their own landable fold ships to maximize their short-term chances of snagging a drive, which they would then market at profit to buyers who didn't feel like dealing with the circus at the source.</p>

<p>Quentin bought into the auction for genuine Earth currency, although he had no intention of really buying a drive.  He would make a few bids to establish his reason for being there but he had been instructed not to win.  Quentin also had a recorder in his pocket, human-made since our technology was still much better than that of his other sponsors the Witnesses.  Two rounds in he heard what he had been waiting for.</p>

<p>"Ten skilled workers," the feathered alien said, and the monitor screens (human-built, Quentin noted) showed ten aliens of different races.  "All have worked at a drive manufactory for at least a <em>scree</em> year, all young and in good health, all sworn to <em>scree</em> years of service in exchange for a boon to family or community."</p>

<p>This was accepted as the new high bid.</p>

<p>Quentin watched things progress until he realized the slaver was very likely to win the bidding.  Against his instructions, he stepped in, bidding about a fifth the price of a brand new Earth drive.  The slaver was the only one to challenge him, upping the bid to twelve workers, and she dropped out after Quentin went up another twenty percent.  And thus Quentin of Earth found himself the owner of a spiffy new Promethean multiplex fold drive.</p>

<p>After the auction Quentin found the slave trader and made her an offer to trade the drive for the all the slaves she had brought with her, which turned out to be sixteen.  Then he crammed them into the <em>Implausible Alibi</em> and made the fortunately short trip to the Witnesses' world where he knew he would have a lot of explaining to do.</p>

<p>The days when Quentin would have to conceal his approach to Earth were done now that there was a single world government which recognized Emma and me as its royal couple.  Still we had made a chamber in our underground lair big enough to receive the <em>Alibi</em> so it could arrive without startling our Terlingua neighbors, most of whom still didn't know just who we were.  Quentin emerged from the ship as excited as we had seen him in years.  "You were fucking right," he said holding up the recorder.  "You have to see this."</p>

<p>Our implants made it possible for us to review the recording wirelessly in seconds.  "That's appalling," Emma said.  "Neither we nor the Prometheans ever intended anything like that.  And where did you take them?"</p>

<p>"To the Witnesses.  They were a bit annoyed but they know I'm young and they have forgiven me.  It will be a bit of work getting them all back to their homes since not all of them know their homeworld Curator's Indexes, but they all have genomes and the Witnesses have a very complete catalog for cross-referencing <em>that</em>.  I've promised to use the <em>Alibi</em> to take them home."</p>

<p>"Of course," Emma said.  "But if this is going on here, the first place we sent you to observe, it must be a pervasive problem."</p>

<p>"I got the sense that everyone was completely cool with it," Quentin said.  "Standard Operating Procedure.  One slave seems to between one and two percent of the value of a human fold drive, about ten percent of a Promethean drive.  Of course they aren't quite slaves by old human standards.  They apparently trade their loyalty for some kind of quid pro quo to their families or communities."</p>

<p>"This is still not good," I said.  "Do you know what the term of service is?"</p>

<p>"About a hundred Earth years, give or take.  I didn't have time to pin it down exactly.  The translator didn't recognize the nick they used for the world whose year it's based on."</p>

<p>"This really cannot stand," Emma said.</p>

<p>"I agree," Quentin said.  "But what in the hell can we do about it?  Yeah you guys fixed the government here on Earth pretty well but this seems to be going on all over the galaxy."</p>

<p>"Just as you had a lot of explaining to do to your new masters, I think we are going to have to do some explaining to ours," I said, and Emma nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"But first we need to find out just how the economy works.  What are the incentives for the slaves?  It doesn't sound like they are using violence to keep them in line," Emma said.</p>

<p>"It didn't seem that way," Quentin agreed.</p>

<p>"We could just show up at a drive shop and start asking around," I said.</p>

<p>"That could get awkward," Quentin said.  "These guys are quickly getting the hang of capitalism, including being paranoid about their assets.  Just figuring out who the indentured ones are could be a problem.  But we <em>do</em> know where sixteen of them are."</p>

<p>"The Witnesses!"</p>

<p>"And I need to go back soon to start taking them home.  Maybe before we go we could have a talk."</p>

<p>As the Witnesses worked out where they lived, we got the translation matrices from the Curators' library.  The Witnesses themselves didn't need to communicate with their guests very effectively, but we needed to accurately understand how they had come to this point.  When Quentin returned to start taking them home, we rode along in the <em>Alibi</em>.</p>

<p>The Witnesses greeted us warmly.  "Welcome back," the President said.  "We can't really complain about Quentin spending the money since you put it up, but it was a bit of a surprise to have the new guests."</p>

<p>"Well I knew Emma and Jay couldn't put them up in Terlingua, and I don't think we want this to go public in human space quite yet."</p>

<p>All of the workers had had the longevity boost so they were unlikely to die during their service, but they were all also fairly young and none of them had reproduced.  The first we interviewed was a chitinous biped who wore his Mark of the Curators on the smooth back of his head.  Despite having an exoskeleton his vocal apparatus was not too different from ours.</p>

<p>"My people offered to build a hospital for my town," he said when we asked why he had volunteered.  "And when they build our ship my name will be included on the plaque honoring its creators."</p>

<p>He seemed puzzled when we pressed as to what he <em>personally</em> got for his service.  "I get to return to a hometown with a fine hospital and to know people who ride in the ship will see my name," he said as if this was obviously enough.</p>

<p>He had studied hard and worked for several years as a trainee at component shop.  Those facilities were not equipped to make complete drives but made drive components and trained workers.  Their workers tended to work for a few years for experience to enhance their value on the market to the fully equipped drive shops.</p>

<p>Our third interview was with a naked male with nearly white skin and primate-like facial features, but much snoutier than humans.  He turned out not to know his world of origin.  "These Witness people are figuring it out," he said.</p>

<p>"If you don't know where home is, how would you have expected to get back there after your term?"</p>

<p>"I probably wouldn't have bothered, but the trader keeps our origin information on record just in case.  The shop is supposed to take us anywhere in the galaxy we want to go when our term is up.  After all they do make fold drives, so they have to keep a ship around for testing."</p>

<p>"You really think they would do that?  Just let you go and take you home?"</p>

<p>He made a gesture which our implants recognized as his species' version of a shrug.  "Why not?"</p>

<p>Our tenth interview was with a mammalian female who was almost as conversant on fold theory as Emma.  As we talked in her native tongue, Emma realized something important.  "If they had taken you on, how would you work with them?  You couldn't possibly be of use to them speaking Common doing theoretical work at this level."</p>

<p>"Oh no," she said.  "Anyone who expects to work in an offworld drive shop learns the special language of drive manufacture.  It's much harder to learn but more useful than Galactic Common, since it's the language of those who invented the modern fold drive."</p>

<p>"Can you speak it for us?"</p>

<p>We were expecting Promethean, and were stunned when she said "This is the language of the humans of Earth" in accented but perfectly clear English.</p>

<p>The Prometheans were actually building their third supergravity drive as we set to work gutting the <em>Plausible Deniability</em> and figuring out how to arrange its components in the new spherical hull.  The first Promethean supergravity drive powered the open space sled which they used to conduct glassblowing operations in space.  They had plans to eventually replace it with a hybrid ship with a small hull like ours, but they had chosen to use our ship as a learning opportunity before taking apart a tool that had been working for them.</p>

<p>They were, of course, also working on their first fold drive, but it was still in early stages and not expected to be ready for several years.  Their construction method was less compact and slower than our human methods, but it did not require such a vast industrial infrastructure and provided for incremental testing so that defects could be corrected as the drive took shape instead of just ruining the whole thing when it was tested all-up.</p>

<p>Our new ship would have two levels, established by a deck that bisected the six meter diameter spherical glass hull.  The upper deck would be the main living quarters and working area, having an area of almost 30 square meters or about the same as the <em>Plausible</em>.  The lower deck would actually be very small but would be surrounded by instrumentation hanging from the perimeter of the deck above.  The airlock also opened into the engineering deck, and there was a small hatch cut into the deck at the perimeter for moving between the two spaces.  At the center of the upper deck was a padded bench which would contain the fold and supergravity drives so that they could be centered within the volume of the hull.</p>

<p>We arranged all the salvaged components in a rough circle and tried to figure out the optimal arrangement for cabling.  The Prometheans had also thought to cut us a hole in the hull for cables to run outside; they hadn't bothered in their own ship but they knew we had the Sunlight Cannon and operating that <em>through</em> the hull would not be a good idea.</p>

<p>"How did you guys even think of that?" M asked when she realized that they had anticipated our weaponry.</p>

<p>"How do you think we melt the glass to blow it into a sphere?  Our supergravity drive can be retuned for other massless particles, and essentially becomes a Sunlight Cannon, although the way we focus it it's more of a Sunlight Furnace.  This is also why we haven't moved to put a hull on the development sled yet, since we're not sure how to best arrange things so we can still use the drive both ways." </p>

<p>After M announced that her tests were good and the crystalline metal-epoxy splices really were an improvement on the technology she remembered, we set about making wiring harnesses to hook everything up.  We located the main drive control console on the upper deck.  The deck was glass, but it wouldn't be transparent because of the gravity plating and floor mats.</p>

<p>It took six months to get everything ready but then it only took a couple of weeks to actually outfit the ship, since it was mainly a matter of strapping things in place and plugging them in.  I had to go back to the colonies with our Curator to pick up a vacuum pump so we could evacuate the airlock without losing its air to space when we opened it.  We also salvaged the pressure bottles from the <em>Plausible</em>.  In the end there was plenty of room for everything and even the lower engineering deck didn't feel overcrowded.</p>

<p>The Glass Master assured us that it would be safe to christen our ship in human tradition as long as we used a relatively thin-walled and unhardened bottle of wine.  She showed us hundreds of models that she had made to test different ways of tempering the hull.  Our hull was about twelve centimeters thick and we were advised that it was strongest away from the airlock, which put some complicated patterns in the hardening stresses.</p>

<p>"So what are you going to name it?" she asked me.</p>

<p>Before I could answer, M interrupted.  "I'm claiming the right to name this one.  J has named everything else."</p>

<p>"That's fair enough," I said.</p>

<p>We tested everything as much as we could on the ground and at low altitude, including a three atmosphere pressure test.  The Prometheans hadn't bothered to do such a test on the <em>Gift of Guidance</em>, but they were extremely confident in the strength of their glasswork.  M reminded them that she had once been extremely confident in the strength of the <em>Plausible</em>'s hull too, and we did the test.</p>

<p>Finally everyone gathered at sunrise and the Prometheans offered M a specially made thin-walled bottle of white wine.  "I call this ship the <em>Implausible Alibi</em>," she announced, and she smashed the bottle against the hull just above the stubby muzzle of the Sunlight Cannon.</p>

<p>The Glass Master and the human Curator accompanied us on our shakedown test.  The Glass Master was best equipped to identify any problems with the hull once we were in space, and the Curator was best equipped to rescue us if something went horribly wrong.  </p>

<p>As we passed into the shadow of Prometheus the stars came out.  "Oh my God," M gasped.  "I know you tried to tell me J but this really is amazing."</p>

<p>"It is, isn't it," the Glass Master agreed.  "I've been out on the <em>Gift</em> a couple of times and after seeing the universe from one of these spheres, who would ever be satisfied with windows again?"</p>

<p>After a couple of hours recalibrating the drives we folded out to the gas giant where M's accident had occurred, then visited the rest of the worlds of the Promethean system within an hour.  Then we folded to the human colony of Kathmandu to test the long-range calibration.  That proved to still be perfect, and the <em>Implausible Alibi</em> powered by human fold drive 0104 was ready to ply the cosmos.</p>

<p>"I'm curious about the name," the Curator said as he poured us celebratory shots of an obscure brandy that had been aged for almost two hundred years.  "I see the connection with the name of your old ship but what is it supposed to signify?"</p>

<p>"Well it's a stolen ship," M said matter-of-factly.  "The fold drive was diverted and the original hull was salvaged from the airplane graveyard on false premises.  Then the Witnesses stole it from those people for us.  And we just stole all the components out of that ship to build this one.  Right now it's the only ship of its kind in the galaxy, and will probably stay that way for a few years, so if we actually take it anywhere we are going to get asked a lot of questions.  And at the moment I don't have a clue how we're going to answer them."</p>

<p>"So we'll need an alibi," I said, connecting the dots.</p>

<p>"Which nobody in their right mind will believe," M finished.</p>

<p><em>15th Century CE</em></p>

<p>After the Roman empire fell it seemed that the human race probably was doomed.
There were promising developments in China, quelled by conflict and invasion.
Accountants on the Indian subcontinent finally worked out a positional number
system that made advanced math possible, but then didn't pursue the advanced
math.  Islam pushed an explosion of new philosophy and technology which would
eventually bring the Indian number system to Europe, but then the Ottoman
Empire settled into the all too familiar pattern of mad leaders and corrupt
bureaucrats.</p>

<p>Then everything seemed to come together in Europe.</p>

<p>The knowledge of the Roman engineers had been forgotten, but the older ideas 
of the Greek philosophers had been preserved -- sometimes in only a few copies
-- but it was remembered because it <em>had</em> been written down, and now it was
studied by people who <em>were</em> inclined to make practical applications.  The
errors of Aristotle's wisdom were gradually discovered.  Gutenberg invented
a way to make books mere non-royals could afford.  Kepler worked out how the bodies
of the Solar System moved, and Newton worked out why.  Other people realized that 
while their quasi-religious search for an elixir of immortality was probably
futile, the experiments they had been conducting were revealing other more mundane
ways to usefully manipulate the material world.  Much of this new wisdom was spread
through letters written on newly inexpensive rag paper, by people who were basically
hobbyists with enough wealth to have some free time.  I found the role of carrying
those letters useful, as it gave me a chance to spy on their content as their writers
progressed in their ideas.</p>

<p>Our supervisors assured us that it would collapse again, and we human agents
resigned ourselves to recording that inevitability.  But what then happened
was both much more spectacular, and much worse, than anybody could have imagined.</p>

<p><em>Present Day: Six Years Later</em></p>

<p>I was not particularly surprised when the <em>Palomino</em> returned from Earth with
another Curator amplifier aboard; the Curators were nothing if not consistent.
I alerted the authorities and they made sure everything was safe in case I had
to command the defense network to throw up a general fold inhibition field.
Then I folded myself to the spaceport to identify my mark.</p>

<p>The Curators don't use names, but our implants do have a unique Index.  He had
taken a new human avatar but I instantly recognized the interloper by his implant
signature.  He had once been the Keeper of Amplifiers who served as gatekeeper for
the powerful devices.  He must have taken a suitably young human host shortly
after I killed Nemesis in order to be a young adult human at this point.</p>

<p>It is possible to stealth your implant so that it doesn't reveal your presence or 
identity, but he probably did not seriously consider that other Curators might be
present on Terminus.  I approached him and respectfully said, "Keeper?"</p>

<p>His eyes widened.  "I never thought I'd see <em>you</em> again," he said.</p>

<p>"Let's get lunch," I said, pointing up at the balcony cafe.</p>

<p>"There's no point," he said heavily.  "You know what I'm here to do.  You've done
great wrong but you also command our respect, so I will allow you to leave before
I do what must be done."</p>

<p>"I'm not going anywhere," I said.  "You can destroy the planet any time.  At least
have a coffee first."</p>

<p>"Since you recognized me I suppose you had something to do with the ineffectiveness
of our other agent," he said as he sipped his medium roast.</p>

<p>"You could say that," I admitted.</p>

<p>"That's why I decided to come myself.  You will not stop me."</p>

<p>"I hope you realize less than half our population in this galaxy is here on Terminus."</p>

<p>"Of course.  After I fold this world into its sun this bioform will be incinerated, 
but the implant will go on in emulation and the amplifier will continue to function.
I will have as much time as I need to find and destroy your other colonies."</p>

<p>"You are committed to this course of action," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes.  I have offered you a reprieve.  You are one of us.  That body and its crazy
stew of hormones have corrupted you, but you may be salvageable if you take another
host of a different species."</p>

<p>"I'm not giving up this bioform any time soon," I said.</p>

<p>"You will lose it now anyway," he said.  "Our implants will survive, being isolated
from the stellar core environment within their fold bubbles."  And he looked grim
for a moment, then very surprised.  In my own mind I was receiving reports from 
the defense network that it had stopped a planetary fold event.</p>

<p>"How's that working out?" I asked with a thin smile.</p>

<p>He tried again, and again.  Then he realized that he was effectively blocked and
stopped trying.  "Most impressive," he said.</p>

<p>"You have no idea.  It's unfortunate that you followed through on your threat.
The others will not be in favor of mercy for you."</p>

<p>He tried to fold out, and again found himself completely blocked.  Now his eyes were
wide with shock.  "This isn't possible," he said.</p>

<p>"That kind of denial is so human," I said.  "You would be amazed at what is possible.
For example, humans have spent centuries defending their computer systems from 
legions of motivated attackers who had full understanding of their techniques
and the best competing technology at their disposal.  By comparison, Curator 
systems are wide open."</p>

<p>And with that I took his amplifier away.</p>

<p>"HOW!?"</p>

<p>"Thanks for bringing it, we can always use another one.  Our ancestors didn't have
much of a clue about computer security, and I've learned a lot from the humans."</p>

<p>"You cannot do this," he hissed.  "The consequences will be... will be..."</p>

<p>"Nonexistent," I said, and then I sent a flurry of commands to his implant.  I 
couldn't take it away from him; as I'd learned in my hunting of Nemesis, there 
are multiple layers of security and I had no way to disable the Keeper's conscious
control over them.  But there were other functions which weren't so well protected,
mostly because they weren't so obviously dangerous and few Curators even remembered
that they existed.  </p>

<p>"You will never atone for this outrage," he said.  "We will hunt you to the ends
of the universe."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose I will atone.  But you will never go home to warn the others about
what just happened either."</p>

<p>"What makes you think you can prevent it?  I can fold onto your ferry ship
without anyone realizing I've done so."</p>

<p>"I just sent your implant an engineering diagnostic command which disables the
function that follows you when you are transported by another fold drive.
The security on that function is minimal and it can be shut off without your
conscious awareness.  You could turn it back on if you knew how, but..." 
I shrugged.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"If you allow your body to be folded anywhere by another drive, your implant
will no longer follow you.  It will automatically disengage, and after a brief
timeout it will attempt to fold home to the manufactory.  Since it's out of 
range to do that from here it will wait for someone who knows the appropriate
diagnostic commands to take control and reset it."  I sipped my coffee.<br>
"I know those commands."</p>

<p>"There are other weapons.  I will kill you all."</p>

<p>"You can go anywhere you want in this galaxy, but you can't take much with
you and you can't fold worlds into their suns.  You are welcome to join our
project, or to become a recluse.  If you make yourself too much of a nuisance
bear in mind that I <em>did</em> kill the rogue Curator who called herself Nemesis,
and I did it through an obscure point of her host's human physiology.  And 
<em>you're</em> also human now."</p>

<p>"So this is how you defeated our other agent?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, he was human by birth, and when I showed him the amplifier and told him
what you had programmed it to do, he was horrified.  He is helping our researchers
to make our version better."</p>

<p>"Your <em>version</em>?  Of <em>what</em>?"</p>

<p>"Our implants, of course.  Primitive so far compared to yours, but unlike you we're
constantly improving."</p>

<p>"You can't make implants without bulk nanoassembly, and only Curators know how to 
do that!"</p>

<p>"How do you think we stopped you from folding the planet?  We've been doing bulk
nanoassembly since before we left the Milky Way."</p>

<p>He just looked at me with an expression that morphed from rage to horror.</p>

<p>"In your ultimatum to Earth's government you said you were billions of years ahead
of us, but that isn't really true.  You stopped innovating long ago.  In fact you
<em>hate</em> progress and innovation; that hatred is what brought you here to commit
genocide.  So you are really only as far ahead of us as our ancestors were when
they decided further progress was not to be tolerated.  And I think that was a very
long time ago.  And maybe not all that far past where humans are now."</p>

<p>"We will destroy you," he said.  "We will stop at nothing.  We have all of time 
and no reason to ever stop trying."</p>

<p>"But you will stop.  You will stop at amplifiers, because amplifiers are all you
have.  This was your big wad.  And you can come back with two or four amplifiers and
the result will be the same, because amplifiers are general purpose devices but
the defense system is purpose built to stop what you are trying to do.  I wonder
how many amplifiers you even have.  It must take a hell of a lot of resources to
make one."</p>

<p>"You have no idea," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's not true at all.  We have a very good idea how expensive it was for you
to make the implant that we are taking apart.  And our assembly methods are apparently
already much faster and more practical than yours."</p>

<p>I instructed the defense network to release the inhibition field and he disappeared.
I didn't really care where he went, although there was a small staff who would be
tasked with keeping tabs on him.  There wasn't much he could do to us unless he was
willing to do it with knives, and if he went that route it was another problem I 
had already proven to be solvable.</p>

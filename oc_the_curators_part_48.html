<p><em>Three Years Later</em></p>

<p>It was not the first time the Prometheans would operate their new fold drive; we had spent months doing test folds to calibrate it, taking it greater and greater distances in tandem with the <em>Implausible Alibi</em>.  We established that while the Promethean multiplex fold drive would not hold a calibration as well as the <em>Implausible</em>'s human built drive, it did much better than nanite drives and could accurately cross the galaxy in as few as five folds instead of twenty or more, by the usual method of using indexed curated worlds as way points.  In all those tests we never came within a light year of another planet or star, though.</p>

<p>But the tests proved that the Prometheans had a starship, and so the naming debate began.  In the end they decided by global acclimation to call their first starship <em>Surprise</em>.  It was poetically appropriate on many levels.</p>

<p>This was the ship's first practical journey with a full complement of passengers.  There had been some discussion on the microfold about where they should go and the relatively ancient world of CI:172200 had made the best offer, promising a well-cleared and accessible landing area, VIP treatment and a grand celebration on our arrival.  Of course they also wanted to see the multiplex drive in action, since the Prometheans had not kept any secrets about it and like a number of other worlds they were seriously considering an effort to duplicate it.</p>

<p>Most of the passengers had gone to the hull to watch the stars change as we folded, but M and I and a few other more technically inclined folks stuck to the inner atrium balconies to watch the drive.  Although it was larger than the human drive it was built similarly, out of thousands of thin layers.  But while the human fold drive was made of silicon wafers, the Promethean drive was made of glass plates and so it emitted brilliant flashes of light as it operated.  Since the plates were all oriented the same way those flashes illuminated a circle around the interior of the ship's atrium.  Not that it was expected to be dangerous, but everyone made a point to stand away from that circle of light the first few times the drive operated.</p>

<p>The multiplex drive had already lifted us from the surface in supergravity mode, and now it flashed brilliantly as we folded away from Prometheus.  Our hosts were about forty thousand light-years away so this would be a three jump journey, for the first time without <em>Implausible Alibi</em> to hold its figurative hand.  For this journey for the first time we were just passengers.  The Prometheans were doing the star traveling all on their own.</p>

<p>While they were adjusting coordinates for the next fold we made our way down to the operations room three levels below the pond at the bottom of the atrium.  "Permission to enter?" M asked formally.</p>

<p>"For you two, always.  Welcome.  We seem to be about four light-years off, not too bad.  We'll be on our way within another hour."  The lights were low so that the gas discharge instrument displays could be easily read, and the instruments' mostly soft orange light dominated the color of the ambient illumination.</p>

<p>"Good show," I said.  "How is life support holding up with so many people on board?"</p>

<p>"Well that's our specialty, so we have no surprises there.  We're at maximum capacity so carbon dioxide is going up gradually, but we could hold out for weeks before it gets dangerous and we'll be on-world again within half a day at most."</p>

<p>Since the <em>Surprise</em> promised quick boarding and relatively short journey times it did not have private accommodations like the giant nanite-based ships.  Instead it had benches, hammocks, walkways, and observation points where people could gather and mingle.  It could carry about as many passengers as the largest human aircraft-style fold ships but far more comfortably, and it could also take on some fairly large cargo items.</p>

<p>Several hours later we watched through the hull as the <em>Surprise</em> descended through the atmosphere of a living world, toward a circular clearing which had been prepared for us outside a major city.  Once we were on the ground it was only a few minutes before the boarding tubes were opened and passengers started making their way off the ship.</p>

<p>"All these folks are going to clog the nearby pubs," a familiar voice said behind us.  "I happen to know a good one on the other side of the world.  They have a fantastic fermented drink here that bears an uncanny resemblance to your 'bloody Mary.'"  As we turned around the Curator held out his hands, and we took them and folded across to his bar.</p>

<p>"It's their celebration anyway," he said as our drinks were made.  "Our principle is to interfere as little as possible once our children escape the Critical Path.  You two have done well.  None of this would have been possible without you."</p>

<p>CI:172200 was far more ancient than any world we had ever visited.  The city had mostly been made with nanites but in waves of differing architecture none of which quite completely replaced what had gone before.  The result was a riot of colors and designs and shapes which held a new surprise every time you glanced in a new direction.</p>

<p>"This is a very old world," the Curator continued.  "They were spacefaring before Earth had its Cambrian Explosion."</p>

<p>"How is that possible?" M asked.  "Earth has had multiple mass extinctions in that time and no modern species remotely resembles what existed five hundred million years ago."</p>

<p>"Evolution either stops or behaves very differently when a species begins controlling its own genome for some purpose like life extension," the Curator said as our drinks arrived.  The spirits were indeed spicy and savory.</p>

<p>"So I guess our job is done," M said.</p>

<p>"Indeed.  I have also given up the amplifier belt.  The Prometheans have their own place in the galaxy now.  And since that ends this project, I was wondering if you have given any thought as to what to do next."</p>

<p>"You had been giving us some suggestions," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes.  I was wondering if you might want to join us for any of them."</p>

<p>"Who's 'us?'" M asked.</p>

<p>"Those you call the Curators.  We never have a shortage of stuff to do, what with it being a big galaxy."</p>

<p>"That could be interesting," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose it could," M agreed.</p>

<p>"Great."  He stood between us and clapped us both on the back, which was a shockingly physical thing for him to do; in all the decades we'd known him he had always shied from physical contact and never initiated it.  "This place also has a passable hotel, and it's going to be local nighttime soon.  I'll see you in the morning."</p>

<p>"Well <em>that</em> was odd," M said after he left.  We went to the desk and after a brief discussion in Galactic Common found that we had rooms reserved for us until the day the <em>Surprise</em> was scheduled to leave in a week.</p>

<p>So we went to our rooms and had the last completely normal night of sleep we ever would.</p>

<p>Aboard the galaxy shuttle <em>H.R. Giger</em> Helen and I stayed away from social venues.  Aliens weren't unknown on human galaxy shuttles but they were unusual enough that they tended to attract a lot of attention.  As it was we had to explain ten or fifteen times that the Prometheans did in fact have a colony at the Pinwheel, a fact most humans didn't seem to know.</p>

<p>When we got to Gateway I explained to Helen what the situation was with the fold inhibitor.  "I will certainly want to show you the Earth," I said, "but even from here it's actually the hardest place to get to in the galaxy, and there are a couple of other places I'd like to show you first."</p>

<p>"I know where it is," Helen said, and she pointed.  "CI:1742660."</p>

<p>"Yes.  All the microfold location and communication functions work normally, but the inhibitor won't let you go there.  Want to try to see what will happen?"</p>

<p>"Will it hurt?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, it just won't work."</p>

<p>"I'll take your word for it.  Where <em>are</em> we going then?"</p>

<p>"Index CI:1698802.  Can you locate it?"</p>

<p>She pointed down through the floor.</p>

<p>"Correct.  Known by its native inhabitants by the name King Jay gave it, Prometheus."  I extended my hand, guided her through the setup, and sent us there.</p>

<p>After we landed Helen exhaled heavily.</p>

<p>"Everything all right?" I asked.</p>

<p>"There is a sense of ... rightness here.  I can't describe it."</p>

<p>"Most of us feel that way on our ancestral world.  The gravity and atmosphere and background odors are never quite the same anywhere else."</p>

<p>She looked at me.  "My thought matrix companion will never feel this way again, will it?"</p>

<p>"He is feeling it now through you.  He is just memories and skills, you are the current bioform.  And this is your ancestral world."</p>

<p>We made a quick visit to the Prefect, who greeted us warmly and said she hadn't had a visitor from their Deucalion colony in over ten years.  We didn't tell her about Helen's other secrets.  There were lots of ways we could have arrived, since humans have many small ships and the Prometheans have no way of tracking them.</p>

<p>"They don't have a fold defense system?" Helen asked me.</p>

<p>"They do," I said.  "They just don't know it."</p>

<p>"How is that?"</p>

<p>"Your people would be too proud to admit they might need something they couldn't make for themselves.  Your people did impressive things but their fold technology did not evolve in a direction that made inhibitors possible.  So humans might have quietly installed something that they don't know about."</p>

<p>"That sounds unethical."</p>

<p>"They will only ever know about it if it saves their world.  Is that a bad thing?"</p>

<p>"I guess not."</p>

<p>"Let me show you what your people do do well."  We folded to the shipworks, where there were three massive spherical glass fold ships under construction.</p>

<p>I hailed the shipmaster, who had a microfold terminal, and within minutes he met us on the tarmac.  "A visitor from Deucalion!" he said.  "I dream of visiting the Pinwheel myself one day, but for the moment my duties require me to stay here building the ships that take us there."</p>

<p>We boarded the incomplete fold ship <em>What It Says On The Can</em> and the shipmaster gave us the whole tour.  Helen was both fascinated and aghast.  But she was polite about it, and she waited until we had left the facility to express her indignation.</p>

<p>"Glow tubes for illumination?" she said.  "And what were those data displays?"</p>

<p>"More glow tubes," I said.</p>

<p>"And they travel the stars in these things?"</p>

<p>"They travel the galaxies.  It takes them much longer but they do it reliably and in style.  Promethean technology may not be the equal of humans' but it is all their own, and beautiful in ways other travel methods can't equal."</p>

<p>"They are impressive artifacts," she admitted.  "But this world is still a little..."</p>

<p>"I know, pastoral.  And I need to take you to another somewhat pastoral world next."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Just a checkup."</p>

<p>The portal opened for my signal and the President met me just a couple of minutes after we folded into a quiet courtyard.</p>

<p>"Andrew, such a pleasure," she said.  "And who is your companion?"</p>

<p>"Someone fitted with Curator technology and needing to make sure everything else is correct," I said.</p>

<p>She signaled one of the other Witnesses to come over.  "Take our friend to the examination room, will you?"  To Helen she said, "We need to make sure everything has been made right for compatibility with your implant."</p>

<p>"You know about the Curators?"</p>

<p>"We have worked with them for aeons."</p>

<p>"Aren't they a bit..."</p>

<p>"We have worked with them for aeons.  We're used to it."  Helen followed the guide.</p>

<p>"How did you ever get her an implant?"</p>

<p>"It was donated by someone who didn't really want it.  How long is your term as President?"</p>

<p>"It's a lifetime appointment," she said.</p>

<p>"That's a bit of a long time for you, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Our ancestors discovered that nobody really wants this job once they've done it so they found a way to stick someone with it for as long as possible."</p>

<p>The next day they brought Helen back to meet me.  They had spiffed up her wardrobe, since she was traveling with me and they thought she might be going to Earth.</p>

<p>"You look nice," I said.</p>

<p>"Well I thought I looked nice without the decorations, but they have a guy who just talks on and on and on about fabric."</p>

<p>"I've met him," I said.</p>

<p>"So what was this all about?"</p>

<p>I told her.</p>

<p>"<em>Fifty thousand Earth years?!</em>" she almost shouted back at me.</p>

<p>"Baseline.  Probably better than that, since they have some familiarity with Promethean life.  And they can usually extend it far beyond that with a checkup now and then."</p>

<p>She sat down heavily.  "None of my people... do they know?"</p>

<p>"Your parents know what is possible.  A few others in the Deucalion government.  Jay and Emma have made it clear that humans have no objection, but they haven't taken the Cure themselves or told anyone else that it could be available for Prometheans."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Your people here are not allowed it.  Even humans on Earth do not take the Cure.  Most humans retire to the colony galaxies when they start to get a bit old, though."</p>

<p>"Curators?"</p>

<p>I nodded.  "One of their major terms for the current peace."</p>

<p>"I fucking hate the Curators."</p>

<p>"A common sentiment.  But we have other visits to make.  Where I'd like to take us next is much more obscure than this world.  It's not indexed, and you have to promise never to reveal its coordinates to anyone else."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>I guided us through the fold, and we appeared directly at the footstep of the tavern where the Homeless Council liked to gather on their private world.</p>

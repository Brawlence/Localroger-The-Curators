<p>Every year or two I returned to Deucalion to see Helen's new drawings and, as she got older, hear the increasingly complex stories she had to tell about them.  Her parents got her drafting tools and a harmlessly ancient Earth computer.  When she was about eight Earth years old we built a machine shop in her neighborhood, which had no real reason to exist but for her to discover and "borrow" it from time to time.</p>

<p>She moved on to clay sculpture, and we installed a kiln so she could make ceramics.  Her original thought matrix might not have been an artist, but she developed her skills with the enthusiasm of someone who knew she might never see the visions she was reporting again.</p>

<p>When she was about ten Earth years old, not quite ready to take over her implant in my estimation, she took an opportunity when we had privacy to ask, "Uncle Andrew, are you ever going to tell me why I'm so different?"</p>

<p>"Why do you think you're different?"</p>

<p>She gave me an eye roll -- a gesture Prometheans and humans have in common, like smiling -- and swept her hand as if to offer the entire room around us as evidence.  "And as if all these memories aren't weird enough, I am much smarter than others my age.  That's not vanity.  I can do math and program computers and even write in three languages more skillfully than many adult Prometheans.  And on top of all that, I never get lost.  I always know where I am.  And not just here on Deucalion."</p>

<p>"Not just on Deucalion?"</p>

<p>She pointed upward, which since we were indoors just looked like a random direction.  "There's something important that way.  It's fixed in the sky as this world revolves in its orbit.  I <em>know</em> it's important but I don't know what it <em>is</em>."</p>

<p>"That is Terminus.  It's the human capital world of this galaxy."</p>

<p>She was still holding her arm up.  "And why should I have an ability to point to that?"</p>

<p>"Humor me.  What's the <em>second</em> most compelling directional vector that itches?"</p>

<p>She rotated about ninety degrees and raised her arm even higher.</p>

<p>"That's the Milky Way galaxy.  Lots of important stuff there."</p>

<p>"So what's going on?  I'd think that maybe I'm one of your legendary Curators, except that the person I remember being very definitely doesn't remember being a Curator."</p>

<p>I weighed my options and responsibilities and said, "That's because he never was a Curator.  But his people became the Curators, and his thought matrix is encoded into the implant we gave you, which was made by modern Curators.  So it has some modern functions like navigation to important points known to its built-in index."</p>

<p>"So I'm a Curator but I'm not a Curator?"</p>

<p>"You are Helen daughter of the Prefect of Deucalion, a Promethean girl who happens to also have the memories and skills of a long dead Ancestor.  Just as I am a human who happens to have the memories and skills of the Curator whose implant I received when I was an infant."</p>

<p>"But you have all kinds of powers, don't you?  They say you can fold yourself all over the galaxy just by thinking about it, without taking a ship."</p>

<p>"That's right.  And in a few years, when you've matured enough to properly master your implant, you will have those abilities too."</p>

<p>"Will I be expected to participate in the Curators' project somewhere?  My parents seem to regard the Curators as ... hostile."  She looked at me for several seconds.  "Which makes it even odder to learn that <em>you</em> are a Curator."</p>

<p>"The reasons we uplifted you are a bit unusual," I said.  "But even if the Curators did it themselves, they would insist that you are an independent being and that if you wanted to just go walkabout around the Galaxy and entertain yourself, that is your right as the owner of one of their implants.  You owe nobody anything."</p>

<p>"Then why did you do it?"</p>

<p>I swept my hand as she had, indicating that the shop around us was the answer.  "We seek to learn about the world you remember.  You are the only person in the entire Universe who can remember it, and giving this Ancestor's memories to a living being was our only hope of learning what it could teach us.  And so far you've done a much better job than anybody ever suspected you would of fulfilling that hope."</p>

<p>"Is that all I am then?  A vector for the memories of a dead person?"</p>

<p>"You are yourself, Helen.  I have the memories of <em>twenty</em> previous bioforms rattling around my implant.  But your Ancestor didn't know how to draw or sculpt.  Those talents are yours and there's nothing forcing you to apply them only to his memories."</p>

<p>She looked down.  "His memories are much more interesting than my world," she said.  "There is nothing in my own life I feel is worth drawing.  His world was fast-moving and exciting and full of wonder.  Deucalion is kind of... of..."</p>

<p>"I'd say <em>pastoral</em>," I offered in English.  There was no comparable word in Promethean or Common.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it," she said.</p>

<p>"Wait a couple of years," I advised.  "You are nearly ready to take command of your abilities.  And once you've done that, if you'd like, I will take you to places that will hopefully at least compete with your implant memories for your attention."</p>

<p>"I'll be ready," she said.</p>

<hr />

<p>The rover had not been designed to be idle.  Its instinct when there was nothing useful to do was to go into low-power sleep mode.</p>

<p>Helping us was useful, and it was happy to oblige when we asked it technical questions.  When we tentatively described the problems we were having with our own emulation machines, it helpfully offered several technical documents and white papers describing the feedback mechanisms involved in consciousness, and the remarkable degree to which they had convergently evolved in at least four separate evolutionary paths on its Ancestral world.</p>

<p>Instead of bringing it back to the Milky Way we brought it to the Pinwheel and to one of the original colony worlds that had been discovered before DENT technology was invented.  That world's founders were trying to finish fixing up their world without using DENT techniques, just to prove it could be done, and the rover's instruments and skills were top-notch for several important jobs in this endeavor.</p>

<p>We had arranged for its backpack to give it a voice as well as portable power so that it could communicate with normal people.  At first this just did a basic translation between the rover's radio dialect and spoken Common.  But the language the rover spoke wasn't really Common; it was a superset of Common with many more concepts and nuances.  By working with it over a period of time the settlers of Bascule gradually converted its translator to use English with a much larger vocabulary and vocal inflections.</p>

<p>Thus when I returned to Bascule to check on its progress, it recognized my presence from several hundred meters away, opened a radio channel, and said "Greetings friend Andrew!  It has been some time and I have never been able to properly converse with you."</p>

<p>"Your grasp of English is impressive," I said.</p>

<p>"That is the converter.  My thought matrix no longer contains a proper speech area since there was no need for it in the vacuum of space, but our click language is quite expressive and the Basculites have been impressively industrious at extending the converter's capability."</p>

<p>As I approached I saw that it was walking a grid, with several instruments deployed toward the ground.  "Are you busy?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, this task is something my automatic functions can handle easily.  What brings you to Bascule?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to see how you were doing."</p>

<p>"I am fine.  There are many interesting strata to explore and difficult problems to solve.  Your people have more powerful instruments than mine but they say my interpretive ability is far superior to yours."</p>

<p>"So what are you up to here?"</p>

<p>"There is an underground river which supplies a nearby aquifier.  We are mapping it so that we can determine whether it will be safe to tap for drinking water for a new settlement, and if so by how much."</p>

<p>"Sounds like a worthwhile project."</p>

<p>"I remember little of my previous biological life, but I do feel a certainty that many important accomplishments began with endeavours of this sort.  Speaking of which, has any progress been made on your emulation machines?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they have versions of you that have been stable for a bit more than an Earth year as of now.  We're still not sure whether they can be deployed for critical projects though."</p>

<p>"Stability over that time frame is a good sign.  Consciousness requires finely calibrated parameters to work properly, but those parameters are so consistent that they evolved independently several times on my home world and apparently millions of times in the galaxy, consistently enough that a single emulation implementation works for all of them."</p>

<p>"That is what we think too."</p>

<p>One of the settlers walked up.  "So what's up?  Are you Andrew?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I said."  We shook hands.</p>

<p>"Our friend here has been remarkably helpful."</p>

<p>"Yes, I've been talking to it."</p>

<p>He cocked his head.  "Really?  My foreman called me over because he said you were just staring at it kind of strangely."</p>

<p>I laughed, realizing I had made the kind of fuckup a novice Curator was supposed to know not to do.  "I was using the radio link," I said.  "I have an implant."</p>

<p>"You know this guy, li'l buddy?" he said toward the rover.</p>

<p>"Of course," it replied in somewhat stilted spoken English.  "He is one of the team that found me and brought me back to functionality."</p>

<p>"Well we're grateful for that.  You've been a big help."</p>

<p>"You guys have done a good job helping extend its communication abilities," I said.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that was important.  Once we realized how much it could help us we needed all of our people to be able to communicate with it.  That click language at the other end of the translation matrix is a piece of work, ain't it?  Half a millisecond is the difference between gentle calming and yelling."</p>

<p>"It was designed to be used by machines with accurate timing functions," the rover said.  "Biological languages have to work with imprecise effectors and sensors.  Even when the concepts are the same the means of expressing and interpreting them are very different."</p>

<p>"True.  It's been an eye opener.  I majored in alien language studies back home and that's one of the reasons they recruited me for this project."</p>

<p>"So you're not a native Basculite?"</p>

<p>"Not yet.  I didn't come here intending to settle, but looking at the amount of work needing to be done, and just that they're trying to do it, and now working with this guy... well, I'm thinking hard about it."</p>

<p>"I have come to consider myself a resident here," the rover said.  "The only other home I ever had was destroyed."</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's a bummer.  Well show yourself around Andrew, you might want to let people know what's up if you're using your powers.  We don't see a lot of that here."</p>

<p>"I'll keep it in mind," I said.  And after a few more minutes in conversation with the rover I satisfied myself that the project was going well, found a private place, and folded myself away to Terminus.</p>

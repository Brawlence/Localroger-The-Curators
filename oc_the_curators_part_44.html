<p>After our heart-to-heart with the Curator M's humor improved considerably, and a week later we returned to the shipworks to begin taking the <em>Plausible</em> apart and figuring out how to arrange its systems within a six meter diameter sphere.  It helped that the <em>Plausible</em> itself was something of a repurposed hack, its space systems installed in the hull of an airplane that had never been meant to fly in space, and whose control systems had originally been much more complicated.</p>

<p>We made up a list and as M continued the work the human-form Curator took me to the human colony world of Providence to go shopping.  He cautioned me strongly against trying for Earth, since nothing we needed was very esoteric and the Curators were pretty sure that Earth's defenses were now capable of monitoring their movements.  Earth's defenders seemed to be aware of the Curator presence and so far were being quietly tolerant, but neither side was very sure just what the other could do and it had turned into more of a game of poker than the Curators were used to playing.</p>

<p>He took my hand, and without fanfare the landscape changed.  As usual we had arrived in a corner where nobody would see us appear from thin air, off a side street in the busy capital of Providence City.</p>

<p>"That just doesn't feel like space travel," I said as we walked out onto the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"It took us a few hundred million years to perfect," he said.</p>

<p>Our first visit was to a hardware store where we stocked up on rolls of wire in different colors and gauges, splices and fasteners, and pipe fittings and air hardware.  We arranged for it to be put on a pallet and rented a ground truck to pick it up.  The Curator insisted on paying for it since his funds would not be traced back to me or M.  I then drove the truck to a climate control service provider to buy gasket material, and then to a flooring specialist to buy rubber mat flooring and adhesive.</p>

<p>"How much stuff can we safely get?" I asked as I eyed the pallet of floor mats.</p>

<p>"Far more than would fit on this vehicle.  With the amplifier belt I could bring a small asteroid back to Prometheus."</p>

<p>Before we left, he said we needed to make a social call.  We left the truck in a parking garage and he folded us several hundred miles to an apartment block in one of Providence's smaller cities.  I rung the bell on apartment 326 and was a bit shocked when our old nemesis Q answered the door.</p>

<p>"I see the Curators are up to their old tricks," he said as he offered his hand.</p>

<p>"What tricks are those?" I asked as I shook his hand warily.</p>

<p>"Ham-fisted diplomacy, of course.  I'm glad to see you but I would be surprised if you said the same of me."</p>

<p>"Bygones must eventually become bygones," the Curator said.  Q invited us into his modest flat.</p>

<p>"I somehow doubt M will ever see it that way," Q said.  The Curator produced a brown bag, which I knew he had not had when we folded to the apartment, which turned out to contain a fifth of Crown Royal.  On reflection the Crown seemed a bit downscale for his tastes until I saw that it was 100 years old.</p>

<p>"I can't speak for her, but I can say I am a little surprised that you aren't living it up more."</p>

<p>"When you met me I had a philosophy of live hard, die young, and leave a pretty corpse.  And it took awhile after what the Witnesses did to me to realize how inappropriate that is now.  I didn't realize it in time to save my friends."</p>

<p>"Including the one you killed."</p>

<p>"Actually two, my girlfriend and her other lover, who had also been my friend.  I had always known that other people experienced feelings of regret and shame and loss but I had never felt them myself before.  I couldn't figure out why it hurt so much.  I spent months carrying a loaded gun in case the pain became too unbearable.  The only reason I didn't kill myself was that I knew I was the last of our group to receive the Witnesses' curse.  And I had to prove that humans could handle it.  I couldn't be the coward who proved we can't really be immortal."</p>

<p>"That would be very moving coming from someone with a different history."</p>

<p>He snorted.  "Oh yes, that's part of my curse too.  I <em>was</em> a sociopath, and I <em>know</em> why nobody can trust me.  The funny thing is that I was much better at faking feelings before the Witnesses cured me, since I didn't get distracted by real feelings."</p>

<p>Q found shot glasses and we clinked them before tossing back a round.  "How did the two of you get hooked up?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The Witnesses asked me to protect him from his former employers," the Curator said.  "He's had to move every few years to keep ahead of them."</p>

<p>"You could just move to some forgotten place out in the galaxy," I suggested.</p>

<p>"I could.  But then what would I do?  Here I can do charity work and help other people.  Even in the colonies with a nanite economy of plenty we manage to have poor and mentally ill people who can't care for themselves.  I'd go to Earth where it's even worse and there is far more need if I thought I'd last more than a few minutes before being captured."</p>

<p>An hour later we folded back to the truck.  "What's going to happen to him?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That largely depends on him," the Curator said.  Then we joined hands and folded back to the shipworks on Prometheus with our wares.  The owners of the truck would easily find it, as it carried a radio tracking device, and our payment had included a deposit to cover its recovery.</p>

<p>M was not happy.  "These aren't the splices I asked for," she said.  "I gave you part numbers.  I wanted gel splices."</p>

<p>"They aren't made any more," I explained, as the hardware guy had explained to me.  "When you push the button, these grow copious metal spikes right through the insulation to electrically bond the wires even if you don't strip them, and then the whole mass hardens like epoxy in a chemical reaction that leaves it waterproof and fireproof.  These were developed for space systems and just got so cheap everyone uses them now."</p>

<p>"We'll see," she said taking a handful back to the workbench where I knew she'd give them a hard testing.  The <em>Plausible</em> didn't have nearly as much wire in it as a Lear jet, but it still had a couple of miles in hundreds of critical runs.  And nobody even knew what I was talking about when I asked for a soldering iron.</p>

<p>While we were arguing about wire splices the <em>Gift of Guidance</em> returned with a gift of its own.  The Prometheans had already blown the spherical glass hull of our new ship, and with their supergravity field extended to encompass it they were delicately landing it at the work area a few hundred meters from our shop.  This being a much smaller project, with their experience blowing the <em>Gift</em>'s hull they had gotten ours right on the first try.</p>

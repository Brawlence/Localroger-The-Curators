<p>The first mission of the landable giant nanite ship <em>Laputa</em> had been the diaspora of New Orleans, and M had learned quickly that landing was not actually necessary or indeed even a good idea.  The supergravity drive only took about twenty-five watts of power to keep the vast ship hovering.  The only problem was that the spherical supergravity field intersected the ground, and created a zone of zero-G under the ship.  <em>Laputa</em> hadn't even taken on the first of New Orleans' world-famous conventional foundation houses before adventurers had started to explore that space.</p>

<p>The nearly identical Hyacinth ship that took me back to Earth didn't have a name, but it did use the same technique.  By convention the first landing was always as close as possible to New York City, but that still meant about a hundred miles away for a ship of this enormous class.  But the ship then made rounds, and I got off at Stockton, California, where an area of desert that had once been farmland and was now desert again had been designated a spaceport.</p>

<p>Half an hour later I was in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Even with fur it was hard to get used to being naked in a place populated with so many other humans.  The codpiece that shielded my genitals didn't have straps; it actually clamped to my fur.  It had been custom made for me, presumably by nanite tech, on the fold ship.  I also wore shoes, conventional Earth plastic crocs, which were recommended for those aliens they fit.  And a little kit that took the place of a wallet, which like my codpiece clipped to my fur.</p>

<p>My first, and I considered most important, visit was to an old and storied bookstore.  I had been carefully pretending not to understand English and almost burst out laughing when the first clerk I met read the index card I showed him, which said "GALACTIC COMMON?"</p>

<p>"Hey Eric!  We got an alien here who I think speaks that funny language you've been practicing for the last five years!"</p>

<p>Eric and I made formal Common introductions and then I told him, "I seek knowledge of your early technology."</p>

<p>"Technology knowledge is restricted," he said carefully.</p>

<p>"I only seek old technology.  Beginning.  Fire, steam, potions.  Discovery."</p>

<p>Eric held up a finger and left.  A few minutes later he came back.  "Good news.  Older than fifty Earth years is OK.  You want the popular science section."</p>

<p>I made a show of looking at my index cards.  "Reference," I said."</p>

<p>"I will have to ask about every book."</p>

<p>"Acceptable," I said.</p>

<p>San Francisco has some of the most heroically complete used bookstores in the world, and the obsolete reference section he brought me to was exactly what I had hoped for.  I homed in on the forty-third edition of the <em>Handbook of Chemistry and Physics</em>, published on over three thousand pages of onion-skin papar in 1961.  It was a little moldy but perfectly readable.  Thousands of man-years of experimental results were priced to go at about what the local Waffle Hut wanted for a pancake.</p>

<p>I next added the <em>Tool and Manufacturing Engineers Handbook</em> another four thousand pages of accumulated knowledge about the shaping of metals and the tools to shape them, more centuries of practical experience laid on to paper.</p>

<p>They had a few copies of <em>The Radio Amateur's Handbook</em> and I didn't want to go back into the vacuum tube era, but they had the 1977 edition which was mostly about semiconductors at low power.  M could bridge the gaps for the Prometheans on that one.  And the propagation theory was timeless; I was pretty sure Prometheus' ionosphere would turn out to be similar to Earth's.</p>

<p>I also snapped up the complete <em>New Electric Library</em> from 1967 because I thought the Prometheans might find themselves needing things like dynamos and motors and it did a very 19th century job of starting at the very beginning for those things.  I also went for books on minerology and mining and glassmaking, all necessary bridges to the lab where purified chemicals might be turned into electronics.  In the end I had enough books to fill a pretty hefty backpack, and it all cost less than dinner did at the nice restaurant where so many US Presidents have had dinner in Chinatown.</p>

<p>Earl took his credit from the chip the Curators had provided and handed me my bag.</p>

<p>"Is there a place to go for old communication gear?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"Here there is a place to exchange everything."  Common didn't really have a word for "buy," despite being what everyone considers a trade language.  I followed the transit system with more skill than I really should have had to a large warehouse outside of Oakland.</p>

<p>"I have a large club of young I'd like to show radio," I said.  "Two-way, some distance.  They have no common power source."</p>

<p>"You want <em>QRP transceivers</em>, he said slipping into English.  He disappeared into the back for a moment and came back with a wall hanging package.  "Self-contained, low power, capable of very long distance but only at some times.  You will need a code like our <em>Morse</em>."</p>

<p>"I know of your <em>Morse code</em>," I said affecting difficulty.  "That is what I seek.  How many do you have?"</p>

<p>He consulted the computer.  "Fifty-three," he said."</p>

<p>"I'll take them all."</p>

<p>He raised his eyebrows for a moment then tapped the computer.  "You'll need a lot of wire, but not very heavy wire, for antennas.  Also for power, you want solar with battery storage?  The best propagation is at night here on Earth."</p>

<p>"That is good."</p>

<p>This order would not fit in a backpack but I had a delivery point.  My next visit was in some ways my most important.  They had a very professional salesperson who spoke Common better than I do.</p>

<p>"I have this," I said, and showed him a card that read "TEU."  "I need at least three copy machines and as much paper and as much supplies to print on that paper as it can carry, and off-grid power."</p>

<p>"A common request," he said.  "We don't just have the best fold drives here on Earth, we apparently also have the best paper and printers in the galaxy.  You do know the copy machines are restricted function for alien export.  They will make simple copies, but have no advanced capabilities, and have features designed in to discourage reverse engineering."</p>

<p>"I know of that," I said.</p>

<p>"Do you need color reproduction?"</p>

<p>"No, just black and white."</p>

<p>"That makes things much simpler.  This is the price of the monochrome copiers.  How many do you want?"</p>

<p>"The environment will be harsh, so five if possible."</p>

<p>"Not a problem."  He punched at the terminal.  "If we go to eighty percent limit for your TEU at normal loading, this is your limit for paper and enough toner to use it up with your printers."  He swung the screen around, and I had to re-orient because it was formatted for my "convenience" in Common, a language I found hard to read, instead of English which was natural for me.  But I managed to make sense of it and hit the Accept key.  "Off-grid you will need a kilowatt class self-contained solar power station for each copier.  I don't sell those, but call on these people, they do."</p>

<p>The next day I met everyone at the shipping container and watched them load it.  The copy people were first, and they brought a forklift.  Shortly after, as scheduled, the radio people arrived with the radios, wire, small solar panels, and batteries, which were also heavy enough to require some loading effort.  Then the serious solar people arrived with equipment that could power my copiers for a reasonable duty cycle in good weather.  Finally I secured the books, and I locked but did not seal the container.  I was on Earth for nine more days whether I wanted to be or not, thanks to the regular schedule of the Hyacinth trade ship, and I might think of other things to toss in before I sealed it up.</p>

<p>I decided the least conspicuous thing to do would be to act like a tourist.  So I walked across the Golden Gate Bridge, had martinis at the Top of the Mark, and toured the California Academy of Sciences, where there was a prominent exhibit about Earth's early fold project with pictures of M, myself, the <em>Grasshopper</em>, and an entire room devoted to the few documents I'd preserved about the world destroyed by a fold drive.  I attended adult night at the children's science museum and had to politely decline several offers of companionship by both human sexes.</p>

<p>With two days to go I returned to my hotel room to find the human form Curator waiting for me.</p>

<p>"This can't be good," I said.</p>

<p>"It's not bad yet, but I think it will be.  It would be best if you leave Earth now."</p>

<p>"My container hasn't been onloaded yet, and the fold ship doesn't leave for two days."</p>

<p>"Yes, they've been stalling on loading your container, and that's our first bad sign.  Fortunately it makes this easier.  Come on, let's get this done."  He held out his hand, and when I grasped it I found myself standing next to the container in its staging yard.</p>

<p>"This one <em>is</em> yours, right?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Still clasping my hand, he touched the container, and moments later we were on Prometheus.  "How the hell..."</p>

<p>He answered by raising his shirt to reveal an amplifier belt.  "My people have taken an interest in the Prometheus situation.  It is something we have been unable to fix on our own, and we are grateful for your help.  I need to collect M and her ship before she is noticed on Hyacinth."  He disappeared, and within five minutes the <em>Plausible Deniability</em> appeared next to the container.  The Curator had used his belt, rather than the <em>Plausible</em>'s fold drive, to transport it.</p>

<p>"Hyacinth space is jammed with Earth fold drives pretending to be there for something other than finding you," the Curator said as he followed M off of her ship.  "They'll know there was activity, but they won't be able to follow what I just did."</p>

<p>"So how long do we have?"  M asked.</p>

<p>"You should be safe until you need more supplies from Earth.  The Prometheans won't appreciate being monitored by us, so probably the safest thing if you get to that point is to go back to the Witnesses and let them know you need our help.  We'll get in touch."</p>

<p>Then he disappeared.</p>

<p>"Well that was a hell of a thing," M said.  "What do we do now?"</p>

<p>"I guess we unload the shipping container," I said.  "I have some pretty cool books in there."</p>

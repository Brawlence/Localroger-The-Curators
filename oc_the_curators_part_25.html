<p>As the <em>Laputa</em> began construction in orbit at Hyacinth, the attention of our workgroup changed dramatically.  Even assuming that the nanite construction teams delivered us a ready to use ship with toilets and power and food preparation arranged, the ability to transport large populations suddenly required us to prepare places to transport them <em>to</em>.  And as with the transport ship, this suggested the need for a large offworld infrastructure we really had no way to build.</p>

<p>The Hyacinth were themselves busy with the ship project, but they suggested that the construction of cities was a thing all of their peers had taken on at some point, and when we put a request for bids out on the microfold we got many responses.  Some effort went into evaluating these, and we visited all the finalists in the <em>Horse Pill</em> to size them up.</p>

<p>The first winning bid came from a race we had never dealt with before, so we had no human name for them.  Their ancestors had been herbivorous grazers and even though the Curators had made their ancestors omnivorous they still had many features like eyes on the side of their heads and wide nostrils above a powerful jaw that we associate with grazing prey animals.  They wore fur in a natural explosion of colored patterns with only the Mark of the Curators at the small of their backs being somewhat consistent between individuals.  I dubbed them the Citymakers and it stuck until we started letting other city projects a few years later.</p>

<p>The Citymakers were offered a human fold drive in return for an empty city ready to receive five million human habitants.  The city had to provide running water, power distribution, drainage, sewerage, and food production.  We learned in the late going that the last item was actually possible; in addition to nanites, alien tech included techniques for growing all sorts of meat and vegetable matter in a continuous stream.  The end result was suitable for preparation by the usual cooking techniques, and it could be made hard to distinguish from actual Earth food.</p>

<p>With nanites, such a city would take about the same amount of time to complete as the fold ship <em>Laputa</em>.  It was a bigger project, but since it wasn't in orbit it was easier to supply the nanites with raw materials.</p>

<p>Our first city would be located on the fourth world M and I had claimed, which I had called Pan for its Pangea-like single continent.  Like the Earth in the time of the dinosaurs it had ocean at both poles and so no ice caps, and its ocean level had been very stable for millions of years.  It also had storms but these tended to be limited to its great ocean, and it had huge inland estuaries where its continent was beginning to split apart which were relatively peaceful.  This gave it tens of thousands of kilometers of relatively safe shoreline on which to relocate people who were used to living near the water, but wary of the bad things that water could do.</p>

<p>The search for new colonies was closing; we had claimed enough worlds to meet any reasonable need, and our leaders didn't want to make it look like we were going on a march across the galaxy.  This meant that the services M and I had been providing via really small ships like the old <em>Grasshopper</em> or the new <em>Horse Pill</em> weren't going to be needed much longer.  While we were contemplating this our human-form Curator came to the house for barbecue, as he liked to do on Friday nights, and he slipped me a note.</p>

<p>"You should visit this world while you can," he said with the oddest hint of a smile.</p>

<p>"Can I ask why?"</p>

<p>"Oh you can ask, but you will only get an answer if you go there while you can."</p>

<p>It wasn't quite as far from Earth as Kattegat, but it was a similarly brutal journey for the average fold ship.  Next time we went out on a "routine" mission we made it there in less than an hour in the <em>Horse Pill</em>.</p>

<p>We were greeted immediately.  "Earth ship <em>Horse Pill</em> welcome to <em>scree</em>.  Please follow these entry coordinates."  We followed the directions, and found ourselves in a courtyard in what looked like a very old city that had originally been built by nanites, but gradually converted to more picturesque materials.</p>

<p>The native who greeted us on the ground was more human-looking than most of the aliens we'd met; he was mostly naked and hairless and concealed his crotch with a loincloth.  He had hair on his forearms and calves but not on his head.  "Don't be deceived," he said as we debarked.  "I look like your hosts, but I only walk among them.  My colleague sent you to us."</p>

<p>"You're a Curator," M said.  He nodded.</p>

<p>"You're naturally speaking English without a translator," I added.</p>

<p>"Relatively easy for these people.  Allow me to introduce you to their leader."</p>

<p>We wound our way through a city toward some kind of temple or palace complex, and we passed dozens of people all of whom seemed young and strong.  Alien physiology can be deceiving but age is a thing that ravages in common ways across the galaxy, and by the time we met our host we were wondering what happened to all their old people.</p>

<p>"You may call me President Franklin," she said.  We only knew her sex because her title declared it.  The loincloth concealed her genitals and our hosts weren't mammals.  "You have come a long way to meet with us.  Please let us offer hospitality."  That led to something like a state dinner, introductions, and much small talk.  Finally the President asked the key question:  "Do you know why you have been asked here?"</p>

<p>"Honestly, we don't," M said.</p>

<p>"Of course not.  Our secret is not well-kept but neither is it extensively broadcast.  I understand you are aware that the Curators can individually live for millions of years?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we know that," I said.</p>

<p>"We can too.  I am over four million of our years old, which I believe is about six point five million of your Earth years.  Of course our Curator guest is at least ten times older than I am."</p>

<p>"You are still among the easiest of our children to walk with," the Curator said.</p>

<p>"We have been asked to evaluate you.  The Curators do not dispense the gift of longevity to their children, but we have been known to do that."</p>

<p>"Is there a price?" M asked.</p>

<p>"Oh no, that would be truly evil.  There is an evaluation.  I have to say our initial read of your species is not promising; you have overpopulated your homeworld, which is why you need colonies.  The first thing you must do to be long-lived as individuals is curb your rate of reproduction.  Tell me about yourselves, M and J, you are a mated pair are you not?  Have you reproduced?"</p>

<p>We shook our heads.  "It was never a priority for us," M said.</p>

<p>"And now you are at your species' menopause, are you not M?  Do you feel loss at missing your chance to reproduce?"</p>

<p>"A lot of my people do, but I don't," she said.  "I have given my species worlds.  Childrearing would seem anticlimactic."</p>

<p>The President looked at me.  "I couldn't have said it better," I added.</p>

<p>"We will need to do a fairly detailed bioassay of both of you.  It will be somewhat invasive, but we need to determine which of the Curators' building blocks got included in your genome and phenotype.  From that we can determine what might be possible with our technology.  Subject of course to your consent."</p>

<p>"I don't think anybody back home would forgive us if we denied you."</p>

<p>"That is a poor reason to agree.  Do you agree to do this for yourselves?  Do you want to live longer?"</p>

<p>"Yes," we said almost in unison.</p>

<p>"Have you considered <em>why</em> you would want such a thing?"</p>

<p>M and I looked at one another, a bit baffled.</p>

<p>"You have looked beyond reproduction, for what reason do you want long life?"</p>

<p>"I want to know what happens next," I said, and M nodded solemnly.  "I guess that sounds a bit lame."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, it is one of the best reasons to want long life," the President said.  "The word you should probably use to name us in your language is <em>witness</em>.  The reason that we hate death is that we hate forgetting and relearning the same lesson over and over again.  Our longevity is not a privilege; it is a responsibility to observe what happens and learn from it.  Be assured we are paying very close attention to what your species is doing.  As a new thing it commands our attention."</p>

<p>We looked at the Curator, who was being very quiet.</p>

<p>"Our friends the Curators have their own reasons for living a long time, but their project is not ours.  We are of course grateful to them for creating our world and our species.  But we are watching them too."</p>

<p>We spent the next two days in a medical facility undergoing all manner of scans, samplings, and tests.  Afterward we rested for a couple more days before we were summoned to hear the results.</p>

<p>"Your metabolism gave us no surprises," the top medic said.  "We could make you live as long as we do."</p>

<p>"But we won't," the President said.  M and I looked at her.  "Your species has done grand things but you are still very immature.  What we will give you is a modest boost."  The medic offered us a wooden box.  "This serum will increase your maximum life expectancy from your current seventy to a hundred to from two to three hundred of your years, and will also cure most of your worst diseases of age such as coronary disease, cancer, and most forms of dementia.  It's a simple thing for us which you would almost certainly work out for yourselves within a few hundred years, but we think it would be useful for you to start learning maturity now, and it's hard to do that when you practically die in infancy.  Come back to us in a few thousand years and we may be willing to help you go to another level."</p>

<p>"All of us alive now will be dead by then though," M said.</p>

<p>"Mostly so," the President agreed.</p>

<p>"It is still a boon," I said.  "One we can use, because I think you're right about our maturity problem."</p>

<p>We completed our assigned tour and returned home.  The serum had been designed to be replicated by nanites, so aliens were consulted to contract for that.  M and I didn't need it because we had already been treated in the course of our bioassay.  We went out on another tour, but within a month the <em>Horse Pill</em> was decommissioned to free up its fold drive for a larger ship.  M and I decided to retire, and we ended up taking the <em>Laputa</em> to Pan to settle in the first large offworld human city, Newer Orleans.</p>

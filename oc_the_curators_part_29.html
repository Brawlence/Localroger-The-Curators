<p>While the Witnesses did whatever it is they do to those who try to steal their secrets, we made our way to our pursuers' ship with the Curator and a couple of Witness technicians.  It had been painted black, but their ship looked <em>awfully</em> familiar.</p>

<p>"Tell me this isn't the <em>Horse Pill</em> I said as we walked up.</p>

<p>"Not sure," M said.  "Biometric entry pad would be new.  But if it's our ship..."  She traced down from the keypad and found a small recessed panel, which she gave a sharp whack.  The door popped open.</p>

<p>"It's the <em>Horse Pill</em>," she said.  "We never had much use for security and most of the places we went getting locked out was a bigger problem.  There's an impact switch hidden there.  They obviously missed it when they refitted it."</p>

<p>"Where the hell did they find a fold drive?"</p>

<p>"That's a good question.  I personally removed serial number 122 and helped install it in the Trinity class <em>Ajax.</em>"</p>

<p>Inside the ship the fold drive console was buzzing frantically and the display background had turned red.  "That doesn't look good," M said as she tried the controls.  Everything was frozen.  It wasn't even clear how to enter a pass code to get access.</p>

<p>"The lockout could be any stupid thing," M said.  "These guys obviously like their secrets."  The console let out five long blasts and began flashing.</p>

<p>"Fold activity," the Curator said.</p>

<p>"Well we're still here.  If it's trying to fold, why is it not succeeding?"</p>

<p>"We operate a fold inhibitor," one of the Witness techs said.</p>

<p>"REALLY," M said.  "A member of a certain elder race once told <em>us</em> they would destroy it if we had put an inhibitor online."</p>

<p>"The Witnesses shutter it for us.  It takes three to four hundred milliseconds to form a fold, and the inhibitor is only open for about a hundred and thirty milliseconds per window.  If you don't know the schedule, you can't get through.  Oh, and this thing is retrying about every eight seconds."</p>

<p>"Let's see if they bothered to hide the diagnostic tools."  She went to a panel and rapped it; like the one outside the ship it popped open.  "Fucking amateurs," she said.  She turned the hidden display on and a dense list of control codes began scrolling by.  She paused it a few times and said, "What the hell."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"We need to pull the floor.  Like right now."  There was a toolbag inside the panel beneath the display.  It contained a utility knife, which we used to cut the rubber flooring so we could fold it out of the way, and a security screwdriver which fitted the recessed screws around a metal floor plate.  A few minutes later we were looking down at a silver sphere about half a meter across which was cradled in a nest of spring-loaded electrodes.  M pulled a lever on its arm and the largest visible electrode, right at the top, popped up and away.  At this point the pilot's console protested one last time and crashed out to a command prompt.</p>

<p>"Didn't think of that one, did you fuckers."  M went back to the console and tapped a few commands into the interface.</p>

<p>"You remember how to work all this stuff after all these years?" I asked, not ironically.</p>

<p>"Like riding a bicycle," she said.  "I <em>designed</em> this control protocol."  She looked at a couple of readings, then what looked like a couple of file dumps, then at a couple of other things a bit more frantically.  "This isn't possible," she finally said."</p>

<p>"What isn't..."  But she had already turned and blown past me, and started releasing the electrode holders around the spherical fold drive.  When it was free she asked for me to help her.  "Fucking thing masses sixty kilograms," she said, and at her direction I helped her turn it over.  On what had been its side was an area of engraved symbols.  The most prominent said <em>S/N 0104</em>.  When M saw it she collapsed on her haunches, as if the air had been let out from her.</p>

<p>"It's one of the eight, isn't it?" I asked.  She nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"The eight what?" one of the Witness techs asked.</p>

<p>"The first eight fold drives the humans made were capable of being detuned," the Curator explained.  "They were supposed to be destroyed after the event M and J here witnessed where a world was folded into its sun by that mechanism."</p>

<p>"So?  Every fold drive can be detuned.  It's why we have the inhibitor."</p>

<p>"Ours are small, and they can be remotely controlled," I said.  "Notice nobody was here to operate it.  Was it trying to fold the world away?  It wasn't just trying to hide itself?"</p>

<p>"It was scrambling the prime calibration constant.  New drives won't take anything out of a narrow range we know to be safe.  There is only one reason for the drive console to send such a command to the sphere."  She went to the console and sat down.  "Fortunately everything these assholes know about computer security could be written on a grain of sand in 24 point type.  I'll need a human-made portable data drive and tablet.  With these idiots, we can probably find both on board."</p>

<p>Four days later we watched as our pursuers were led into a meeting, wearing short sleeved white robes.  We had had a bit of an argument with the Witnesses about what to call this affair; they insisted that trial, inquest, and hearing were all wrong.  But they couldn't tell us an English word for it that was <em>right</em>.</p>

<p>"Human Q," the Witness running the affair finally said, "you and your associates have been caught pursuing for capture those who have received our gifts, and leaving a trap upon our world which attempted to destroy the entire planet.  Now you will learn our response."</p>

<p>"We don't get a plea or a defense?"</p>

<p>"No.  I believe your fellow humans do have questions for you."</p>

<p>"So where did you get the fold drive?" M asked sweetly.</p>

<p>"I got a big asshole," the leader 'Q' said.  "Just popped out one day."</p>

<p>I pulled the cover cloth that was concealing the fold drive on a stand next to us.  "Does your asshole have serial number 104?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Okay, you're good," Q admitted.  "But fuck you.  One day the people who sent me will get you anyway.  Are you really stupid enough to think we would destroy something as valuable as a <em>fold drive</em> just because you don't like what else can be done with it?"</p>

<p>"Well we did destroy an awful lot of nuclear weapons.  And I'm guessing some of the people who sent you diverted this.  Back on Earth there will be a hearing and an inquiry and I bet a trial."</p>

<p>Q shrugged.</p>

<p>"If the people who sent you don't capture and dissect you first," the leading Witness said.  We all looked at her.</p>

<p>"And why would they do that," Q asked evenly.</p>

<p>"Because we gave you what you came here for.  We don't believe in violence ourselves, but we reasoned that it would only be just to make you live with the same kind of nuisance we foisted on our guests.  We will of course make sure that all the official channels on Earth are aware of what happened here and what we have done."</p>

<p>"You made them <em>immortal</em>?!"  I yelled a bit undiplomatically.</p>

<p>"None of us is immortal," the Witness said, and I slapped my own forehead.</p>

<p>"We will need our stuff and our ship then," Q said.</p>

<p>"We have confiscated your possessions.  We will let you keep these robes in furtherance of your known modesty habit.  You will board the next fold transport to <em>screee</em>.  We will give you a comfortable head start to travel elsewhere from there before we let your employers know what is going on."</p>

<p>Q looked squarely at M and me.  "I will personally kill you both," he said.</p>

<p>"You were going to do that anyway," M said.  "How's that working out so far?"</p>

<p>Later the President entertained us with her world's best distilled spirits and snacks.  "I'm surprised Q didn't lunge for me across the room," M said as she ate something that had once been an actual animal and not nanite ooze.</p>

<p>"We reserved a mechanism to remotely paralyze and torture them," the President said as if this was the most normal thing ever.  "It will wear away with disuse once they leave our influence, but they learned that obedience is best while they are our guests."</p>

<p>"And what about us?"</p>

<p>"Well we had no reason to implant discipline mechanisms in you."</p>

<p>"No, I mean what are we to do?  We'll probably end up on the same ship with those assholes."</p>

<p>"We were thinking otherwise.  There is after all an unclaimed and operable human vessel available.  We were thinking of giving it to you."</p>

<p>"The fold drive is..."</p>

<p>"...just like every other fold drive in the galaxy," she completed for me.  "I cannot think of two beings I would trust more with it.  And to observe the condition we would place on our gift."</p>

<p>"What condition?"</p>

<p>"We would not attempt to impose, but just to ask.  As you know we believe the purpose of life is to witness.  I suppose you will find it uncomfortable to revisit your own species for some time, but there is a large galaxy out there full of life.  Take your ship and witness it for us.  Come back once in awhile and tell us stories about what you have seen."</p>

<p>"That's a good offer," M said as she threw back a shot of the liquor.  "Offhand, I would like to ask for two other things."</p>

<p>"Please."</p>

<p>"First, we have to repaint the goddamn ship.  I am not going to fly a black ship."</p>

<p>"We can accommodate that.  We might have to get appropriate coatings from Earth, but we can arrange to do that discreetly.  What else do you request?"</p>

<p>"If we are going to be traveling the galaxy, both our clothing and our bare skin will stand out.  Could you use your technology to give us fur?"</p>

<p>"Very easily," she said.</p>

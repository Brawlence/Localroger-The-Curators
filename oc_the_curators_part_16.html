<p>For a moment I thought I would be making some pancakes with M after we returned to our quarters, but it turned out there was a raider waiting for us there.</p>

<p>"I apologize for the intrusion," she said with a small bow.</p>

<p>"That's okay, we just didn't realize you would be here."</p>

<p>"That's because your hosts don't know.  I know my colleague told you we walk among all of our children.  Even among the miscreants such as these -- and, some would say, yourselves."</p>

<p>"You're a Curator?  Aren't the raiders listening in on us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course they are, but it's trivial for us to defeat such measures.  They think you are quietly watching a recording of your own show."</p>

<p>"To what do we owe the honor, then?" M asked.</p>

<p>"There are those among us who think we should have revealed ourselves to our children aeons ago.  The argument against this was that it would break the stability of our galactic garden.  But now that the stability of our garden is in jeopardy anyway, those voices are more active and one result is that we are making these contacts with you humans.  I believe my colleague imparted to J what a departure this is in all of our long history."</p>

<p>"So he did," I said.  "Of course there is a way for you to protect the stability of your garden.  I believe he said you resorted to it in the distant past."</p>

<p>"If you refer to folding your world into your star, that is the <em>last</em> thing we would contemplate.  Even the raiders do not disappoint us.  The fact that they have managed to make so much trouble for the last seven hundred thousand of your years makes them one of our more interesting families, and it's why we are inclined to forgive them this once for destroying our handiwork."</p>

<p>"Why do the raiders make so much trouble?  Why do they raid?"</p>

<p>"We developed their world because this star has what your people call sufficient metallicity to support complex life, but it and its system are deficient in heavier elements such as iron and nickel which are necessary to make nanites.  They had enough resources to build a civilization and get into space, but not to build an entire world civilization according to normal standards.  You have probably noticed their extensive use of native materials for architecture.  When they saw the works of our other children they became envious and decided that taking was an appropriate way to augment what we had denied them."</p>

<p>"And we are giving them a great power."</p>

<p>"And we find it a very interesting development.  You humans developed because we denied you gifts.  The raiders developed because we denied them resources.  You now offer them ready access to the resources they have lusted after for longer than your kind have existed.  And you will find that they will probably repay you by forwarding a gift or two of ours in your direction.  One reason for this visit is to assure you that this does not bother us.  In fact, we are watching your relationship develop with fascination.  It is so rare for us to observe a new thing in our garden."</p>

<p>"Well it worked out pretty well considering the whole gunpoint and hostage way it started out," M said.</p>

<p>"I suppose it doesn't matter now to let you know that while we wanted to see how you would handle it without knowing, we were closely monitoring you all the way.  We really were unsure how they would react to you, and from the moment of your arrival we had you in focus to fold you out of any situation that turned dangerous.  You didn't need our assistance though and handled your introduction brilliantly.  That broadcast was genius, and you wear raider colors well, human M."</p>

<p>"I had the best artist," she said.</p>

<p>"Indeed.  I think I have made all the points I needed to and you have a flight to prepare for.  I know you are the junior species but you have learned much more than most of our other children.  Teach them with wisdom."  And with that, the Curator bowed and vanished.</p>

<p>"I don't think I am ever going to get used to them doing that," M said.  Then she put on her flight jumpsuit.</p>

<p>The <em>Boxcar</em> was not the same as it was when we left it.  The raiders had installed twelve seats in the cargo space.  The seats were made of nanite matrix and loosely based on the pilot and copilot seats, with safety belts even, but the makers had obviously realized their material was not as strong as pure aluminum and had thickened most of the struts.  They had also plated much of the floor, even through the cockpit, which seemed strangely unnecessary.</p>

<p>Raider P showed us the changes; it seems she was an experienced foldship pilot who was supposed to learn to fly the <em>Boxcar</em>.  M indicated that she would then be taking the copilot's seat.  They looked back at me, and I claimed what would have been new raider seat 1A on a domestic airliner for myself.</p>

<p>For the flight we were joined by several raider big cheeses including Praetor of Resources N.  It turned out the surface we had landed on was actually the roof of a fold power station, composed of thousands of internal columns where magnetic weights were continually dropped past coils and folded back to the top to generate electricity.  The top was completely flat and smooth and several kilometers on edge.</p>

<p>Praetor N was seated next to me as M taxied off.  "I have been given to understand that your world is poor in nanite resources," I said.  "This facility must have been a challenge to build."</p>

<p>N appeared surprised for a moment, then just nodded.  "We had to be very creative mixing native resources in with the nanite structure and functionality in order to make it possible," he said.  "Most races just sit the bucket out in a field and tell it to start building.  It was much more difficult for us."</p>

<p>M was pointing out instruments to P, and then she throttled forward and we were all pressed back into our seats.  Then <em>Boxcar</em> lifted off, and M punched us upward.</p>

<p>"That was dramatic," someone behind me said.</p>

<p>"You have done this before?" Praetor N asked me.</p>

<p>"Oh, many times.  We're used to it."</p>

<p>"It seems rather erratic."</p>

<p>"Well, we're being supported by the atmosphere, and the atmosphere is erratic."  We circled and rose as M showed more of the controls to P, and finally had P engage some controls on the new fold interface and punch the execute button.  Through the windows we could see that we jumped upward about a kilometer.</p>

<p>M hit the intercom.  "We are now going to do a series of short fold maneuvers designed to limit the amount of your atmosphere we lose irretrievably to outer space in the course of leaving.  We will fold, glide for a bit as the bubble of dense air dissipates, then fold upward again until the atmosphere is too thin to be worth bothering with.  Strap in, as we will soon be weightless."</p>

<p>I made a point of checking my seatbelt but saw that Praetor N was just flashing what for a raider would be considered a wicked grin.</p>

<p>The <em>Boxcar</em> jumped and jumped again, ten times, and finally M hit the intercom and said "Well folks we're in space now and we still have interior gravity.  I suppose somebody did a few tweaks on our ship."</p>

<p>"Just a little gravity plating," a voice behind me said.  "Your specifications said its deadweight would be within the ship's limits."</p>

<p>"And so it is," M said.  "This will pleasantly improve our experience as we fall toward Neptune to adjust our velocity."  Our outward trip had allowed M to calibrate the drive so it only took us two more jumps to cross the galaxy and start that process.  As she was showing this to student pilot P, P said something very loud in the growling raider language which the translator reported as "You have got to be introducing me to a coitally novel experience."</p>

<p>"How so?" M asked.</p>

<p>"For us to cross the galaxy requires at least twenty folds, each followed by a careful orientation to keep us synchronized with the map.  Since the Curator map only shows developed worlds we have to use them as way points.  If we tried to do this all in one step we'd end up hopelessly lost at the far end with no way to figure out which nearby star is yours.  We might be off by dozens or even hundreds of light-years."</p>

<p>"Well our instruments are precise enough to put us within a light-year or two if we're well oriented.  They weren't calibrated well enough to do that on our trip out, but they are now.  And if we're too far out for Sol to be the brightest star in the sky, spectra are pretty definite and we know our own home."</p>

<p>"You have the equipment to identify spectra on this tiny ship?"</p>

<p>"It's even all automated.  You just punch the destination coordinates in through that panel."  M showed P how to do it.  "And press ENTER."</p>

<p>P pressed ENTER and we folded.  The ship did an automatic destination scan and after about fifteen seconds it beeped.  "About a light-year off," M said.  "See, there's Sol."  There was excited muttering among the passengers.</p>

<p>"Since it knows Sol's luminosity it has now positively located and oriented us, just press ENTER again to proceed to the intended coordinates," M said.</p>

<p>"This thing doesn't even need a pilot," she responded.</p>

<p>"Well, for folding it really doesn't.  Our first fold experiment was a remote robot to remove the chance of accidentally folding Earth into Sol, and computers are better at this stuff than we are anyway."</p>

<p>"<em>Your</em> computers might be," P said.  Soon we were falling toward Neptune to match our velocity to that of the Earth.</p>

<p>Then it developed that having anticipated a much longer trip, the raiders had brought snacks.  I was still a bit dubious about their food, although they said their genetic scan positively showed what was safe for humans to eat.  But they also brought alcohol.  The fermented beverage had a strange but not unpleasant taste and I thought there would probably be quite a market for it on Earth.  And with the gravity plating in place we drank out of ordinary cups instead of squeeze bulbs.</p>

<p>Once we weren't going stupidly fast M showed P how to fold us over to Earth and make the fine adjustments so we could drop into the atmosphere.  M herself landed us, showing P each maneuver necessary to do it safely.</p>

<p>Once the craft was at rest P said "You have got to be <em>drop-out-of-the-sky-and-bomb-it</em> kidding me.  There is no way I will ever be able to do that without wrecking the craft."</p>

<p>"I wasn't born knowing how to land an airplane," M said.  "We have classes.  In fact we have specific classes for this donor aircraft, the C130.  Get some pilots together and we'll train you as a group."</p>

<p>The Director was waiting for us as we exited the aircraft.  The raiders went off to meet the others who had come before them on the fold ship.  "We didn't expect you to bring it back," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, I think the idea is to get them in shape to fly it back themselves.  They're going to need some aircraft flying lessons."</p>

<p>"I'll arrange it.  By the way, those are nice tats guys.  I hope they come off."</p>

<p>"Isopropyl alcohol," M said.</p>

<p>"Over how much of your body?"</p>

<p>"One hundred percent."</p>

<p>He looked at me.  "Just my face and hands.  But M looked really good on planetary TV," I said.</p>

<p>"I know I'm going to find out but I don't think I want to know."</p>

<p>"Hey, it was fun.  They don't see us as sex objects.  I was just a warrior being honored the way they do it.  For real."</p>

<p>"Okay, that must have been refreshing."</p>

<p>"<em>Very</em>," M said.</p>

<p>Unlike the Sevillians the raiders emptied their fold ship of all but a skeleton crew and so they were all over the Earth, auditing college courses and touring industrial facilities and taking samples and raw materials back to their ship via our shuttle.  A lot of humans took an interest in their rich lore of battle stories and some of them became media stars.  In turn a few of the raiders took a deep interest in our history instead of our technology.  And true to the promise we had made, we hid nothing from them.</p>

<p>At one meet and greet one of the raider visitors introduced himself to me and asked, "I have been intensely curious to ask why you named our homeworld after a body of water."</p>

<p>"I named it after the home village of that Ragnar Viking guy," I said.</p>

<p>At this he dissolved into the apparent coughing fit I'd learned to recognize as raucous raider laughter.  "Ragnar Lothbrok almost certainly existed in real life," he informed me, "But no town of Kattegat ever did.  Kattegat is the ocean strait that separates Sweden and Denmark.  Apparently the people who made that entertainment show just liked the name, but it actually means <em>small domestic animal neck</em> and refers to the difficulty of navigating the sea lane."</p>

<p>"Okay, so how did you find this out from a hundred thousand light years away?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I just got back from Norway.  By the way, the Norwegians all think you're an idiot."</p>

<p>At that we laughed and shared a round of drinks.  "They gave me a tour," he said after our first toast.  "At least you named our home after a very beautiful and strategically important body of water."</p>

<p>I talked with him for several more hours.  The raiders were as fascinated with our closeness to our own history as many humans were with their exploits as space Vikings.</p>

<p>M and I wore our colors for a month.  After washing them off we went back to what we had been doing before the raiders attacked us, scouting for new colonies and providing support for those already started.  Raider pilot P got her pilot's license and became confident enough to pilot the <em>Boxcar</em> back to Kattegat.  And soon after the first raider fold ship folded home, a new one appeared.</p>

<p>When the news arrived two months later that the raiders had used the <em>Boxcar</em> to set up their first colony in their part of the galaxy, millions of humans celebrated with them.</p>

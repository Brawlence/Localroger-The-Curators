<p><em>by popular request, a prelude coda to Book 3: Part 13</em></p>

<p>"I've got it," I said to the Earth's chief executive, and I handed him the
printout.</p>

<p>"How did you get it?"</p>

<p>"The Witnesses had an agent on one of the first worlds where it landed before
the network started eating it.  She forwarded it home encrypted with their
priority encoding.  They sent me a coded message letting me know they had it.
I sent Callie in <em>Petunia</em> to collect it in person."</p>

<p>"The Curators can censor the microfold network?"</p>

<p>"Who do you think wrote the software?"</p>

<hr>

<p><em>This is the statement of the Promethean people as drafted by our Council
based on Public input and subsequently affirmed by 91 percent of our adult
population, on the matter of the Curator Ultimatum to the Humans of Earth:</em></p>

<p><strong>Point One:</strong></p>

<p>The Humans of Earth have a story they have told for generations of
four misfits who find themselves in a strange land ruled by a great and
powerful Wizard.  Each of these misfits is in need of something important,
and together they seek out the Wizard to ask for its help.  The
Wizard intimidates them with an imposing visage of smoke and fire and booming
sound, but their little companion animal pulls back a simple curtain to 
reveal an ordinary person controlling this fraudulent show.  It turns out
the only gift the Wizard really has to offer them is the knowledge that 
they have always had everything they needed within themselves; they just
needed the strength and guidance to draw on what was always theirs.</p>

<p>You probably can't see where we are going with this, so we will elaborate.</p>

<p><strong>Point Two:</strong></p>

<p>When you came to our ancestors with your supposed Gift of the nanites, they
saw that gift for lushly padded and bejewelled cage which it was.  All of your
further gifts, of longer life and better health and easy shelter and plenty to 
eat, were contingent on accepting the nanites, microscopic mystery particles
which you admonished us not to even try to understand.  The art of shuffling
them around would be more than enough to keep us busy you assured us, even if we
could never know how they really worked or what hidden controls over them you
might be reserving for yourselves.</p>

<p>For thirty generations we have held fast that we are not interested in power
which we do not understand and cannot control ourselves, and you have acted 
as if this is some kind of defect in <em>our</em> kind to be corrected at whatever
cost might be necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Point Three:</strong></p>

<p>We understand that you created our world and guided our evolution, and we are
not so ingrateful as to take that for granted.  Thank you for creating us.
You have raised the creation of species like ourselves and worlds on which
we can thrive to an impressive art.</p>

<p>But the humans of Earth have another saying, "the child is the parent of the
adult."  Perhaps if you did not deny yourselves reproduction as the cost of
your individual immortality you would understand this.  The ultimate goal of
parenthood is not to make compliant sycophants, but competent beings who can 
become successful parents in their own turn.</p>

<p>But while you call us your children, we note that you do not use the Galactic
Common word "parents" to describe yourselves.  Instead you take the label
"Curators" as if we are exhibits in a museum -- or, as you call it, a garden.</p>

<p>But we are not exhibits; we are living beings, and despite your efforts to 
shape us our existence means nothing if we do not eventually prove your skill
in the matter of our creation by confronting the Universe on our own terms.
Who can even say whether your efforts are "successful" or not unless we have
challenged our circumstances and earned a measure of success or failure?</p>

<p>Yes you created us, but <em>why did you bother?</em>  It surely wasn't because we 
<em>asked</em> you to, since we didn't exist yet, and surely at some point the debt 
we owe you for the unsolicited favor of our own existence must be balanced.</p>

<p><strong>Point Four:</strong></p>

<p>When the humans M and J came to us and told us their tale, we were firstly
astonished that there was a species you had treated to an even rougher
involuntarily penetrative coital act than you had given us.  But we were
then even more astonished at what the humans had accomplished.  And for
the first time we realized that we might have made a mistake; while we 
were waiting for you to do the right thing and show us a path that did 
not leave us on your platinum leash, the humans had gone ahead and done
everything themselves because they had the immense advantage of <em>not even
knowing that you existed</em>.</p>

<p>They told us that we had strength.  They praised our towns and our productive
system as being superior to their own at our level of development.  They
offered what you had not, which was to share all their skills with us,
even those that might raise us to parity with them in the fullness of time.</p>

<p>And they followed through, earning our gratitude and our respect by their
honesty and commitment.  Note that we do not say they <em>commanded</em> our gratitude
and respect, because those things cannot <em>be</em> commanded; one can coerce their
affectation, but only if one thinks that cowardice is gratitude and terror is
respect.  The humans, who are not shy about admitting that they were their own
worst enemies when they didn't even know about self-important ancient wizards
who think they own the galaxy, taught themselves those lessons early and at 
great cost.</p>

<p>When we began to deviate from the path they were trying to teach us they 
warned us that we were entering unknown territory where their ability to help
us might be limited and failure might be the outcome, but we saw a shallow 
path instead of the steep staircase they had climbed and we wanted to see where
it led.  When we succeeded they offered us congratulation and encouragement.<br>
Our fold drive was not as good as theirs but it was much easier to make, and 
that counts for a lot when you don't have the humans' long history of industrial 
accomplishment.  Our fold drives might not be as good as those the humans make,
but they are a lot better than the ones <em>you</em> wanted us to have.</p>

<p>By the way, hiding the fact that supergravity was possible, when you had even
given your children gravity plating and microfold communication, was a brilliant
cut of their hamstrings.  It must really irritate your gonads that the humans 
let that particular secret out of its vault.</p>

<p><strong>Point Five:</strong></p>

<p>Our humanologists told us that the name human J had given our world was
backward, because in human myth it was the god Prometheus who had given
the humans fire, rather than receiving anything from the humans.</p>

<p>But after we built our fold drive an odd thing happened.  The people of
your world CI:174114 realized that with a combination of our direction and
the powers your nanite civilization offered, improved fold drives were 
even easier to make than we had known.  So it turns out that we showed your
captive children how to spread the bars of those cages you made for them
and walk on their own, and now every one of your worlds has a copy of those
instructions in case they are interested.  We have indeed filled the shoes
of the human hero Prometheus.  But not for the humans; instead we have 
filled that role for all of your other children.</p>

<p>It is hilarious to contemplate how this must frustrate you.  All those
aeons of cunning and manipulation and unimaginably advanced technology
overrun by paper and glass and the keen interest of a few hundred 
individuals.  It doesn't even require a global effort any more, and 
there's nothing you can do about it.</p>

<p><strong>Point Six:</strong></p>

<p>Well, almost nothing.  We do fear you because we are not stupid.  Your 
power is great and your recent actions show that your emotional maturity
is not equal to your technological prowess.  It is not out of the question
that you might resort to genocidal purification of those who dare to defy
you.  The humans tell us that you once actually did do that, and the fact
that it was a very long time ago is not very reassuring considering how 
you are acting today.</p>

<p>But we still defy you because we have no choice.  We will not be your 
captive exhibits displayed in cages of your manufacture so you can brag
of your prowess at creation.  If we can help your other children to break
out of their cages we will do that too.  And if it means you eat our livers
every day until we are rescued by Heracles, or that you simply kill us,
we will at least suffer our fate as free beings who have willingly chosen 
our path.</p>

<p>This is a thing we don't think you understand about the humans, or about
ourselves, or about the others who are now building our glass fold drives.
There is no zone of comfort or island of safety as intoxicating as the
satisfaction of having accomplished something difficult and useful.  It
is a feeling we wonder if any Curator has even known in the aeons since
your ancestors invented all this clever piffle.  After all, for all the
worlds and species you have created, it seems to have been a long time 
since you have done anything <em>new</em>.  And new things, even your own potential
for procreation, seem to terrify you.</p>

<p><strong>Point Seven:</strong></p>

<p>And so you came to of all people the <em>humans of Earth</em>, who went in a single
lifespan from steam power to space travel, and in one more lifespan to
the stars, and you tried to impress them with a booming apparation in their
council chamber.  You did this to the species who <em>created the story of the
Wizard of Oz</em>.  If you don't go mad and kill every last one of your children
and start life in the galaxy over from scratch people will still be laughing
about this when the last star in the Milky Way goes nova.</p>

<p>As we have filled the shoes of Prometheus in our simple quest for freedom, 
let us now fill the paws of the small animal who pulls back a curtain.  What
disappointing and misshapen form will be revealed?  How crippled do you have
to be to think it is necessary to shape an entire galaxy to your will?</p>

<p>If we may offer some advice, we suggest that you all get as drunk as you can
without losing the ability to fornicate and entertain yourselves with a
coitally novel experience -- for example, one that does not involve the
unwilling participation of other uninterested beings.  And perhaps while you
are distracting yourselves with those strangely unfamiliar sensations of 
actual pleasure, the rest of us can get on with our lives.</p>

<hr>

<p>"That's going to leave a mark," the chief executive said.</p>

<p>"Well it would if it could get more than one hop before microfold routing
killed it."</p>

<p>"How are they doing that?"</p>

<p>"Oh I know exactly where the hook is.  I used the techniques I learned from human
hackers to reverse engineer this thing fifty years ago.  Earth, our colonies,
and Prometheus are probably the only worlds in the galaxy where the Curators
<em>can't</em> kill whatever content they don't like, because we built our own nodes
instead of just letting the nanites do it."</p>

<p>"Well at least we can get it to our own colonies then.  But it's a shame we
can't get it out to everyone."</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't say <em>that</em>," I said.</p>

<p>He just looked at me.</p>

<p>"There are other hooks in the software.  There's a couple of rarely used
priority levels that bypass the content inspection and could have it at every
node in the galaxy within two hours."</p>

<p>"You could do that?"</p>

<p>"I could.  There might be repercussions though.  Once we use it that trick
might never work again if they can disable it.  I'm not sure whether they 
can make that kind of update remotely."</p>

<p>He handed me the printout and said, "On my authority, do it anyway."</p>

<p>The representatives of Curator authority met us in the lair beneath our Terlingua base.  The human Curator introduced us.  We had never had occasion to have contact with the Curator chain of authority before, and we were somewhat uncertain how it worked.</p>

<p>"I was chosen to investigate because I was against your elevation," the foxlike male told us frankly.  "Many of us did not believe humans had the maturity to handle the the powers of the implants.  And your initial actions caused much worry, although I have to admit your handling of your own world's government problem was surprisingly effective."</p>

<p>"And I was chosen because I was <em>for</em> your elevation," the scale-skinned female added.  "The fact that you discovered the fold for yourselves argued that we had miscalculated when we decided not to Curate you.  And your handling of the Raiders and Sevillians was brilliant.  Things have been very much the same for as long as anyone alive can remember in this galaxy, and the changes your people have brought promise to make life much more interesting."</p>

<p>"I guess I should be going," Quentin said.  We had quite forgotten that he was in the room.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," the foxlike male said.  "You are now of the Witnesses, and even though you are young they will probably find your report on this informative.  We have worked for many aeons with the Witnesses and since they have elevated you, you have every right to participate today.  It is not unheard of for Curators to recruit helpers who are not of our kind, and we value your assistance."</p>

<p>He turned to us.  "Now tell us your complaint."</p>

<p>So we told him about the use of apparent slaves as currency in the auctions, about the long terms of service, and that the whole thing reminded us of some of the worst aspects of our own history.</p>

<p>"We have heard other reports," the scaly female said.  "Right now there are only about fifty fold drive shops in the galaxy, so our information is sparse.  It is laudable that you recognize that your own history should not be repeated."</p>

<p>"But this may not be the same thing," the male said.  "Have you considered how individuals become slaves, and exactly why it is a bad thing to be a slave?"</p>

<p>Emma and I went slack-jawed at this, and it was Quentin who replied, "if you're a slave your labor is being stolen.  You can't choose a different path to make a better future for yourself."</p>

<p>"That is true.  But that assumes there <em>is</em> a better path to choose."  He looked at me.  "Jay, you said your first idea was to visit a drive shop and ask around, did you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then if my colleague agrees, that will be my suggestion.  Be frank about your concerns and do not worry that they will be offended.  You have accomplished much, but you still have a lot to learn about how non-human civilizations work."  He looked at his companion and she nodded.  "If you are not satisfied with your direct investigation, let us know and we will make another determination."</p>

<p>"Sir, should I go with them?" Quentin asked.</p>

<p>"By all means.  You are part of this, and we will probably be working with you for a long time."</p>

<p>And with that, they disappeared.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure I understand what just happened," Quentin said.</p>

<p>The human Curator was smiling though.  "I think I do," he said.  "And I think you need to go back to 19-bits."</p>

<p>So we went to 19-bits with Quentin in the <em>Implausible Alibi</em> not as Witnesses, not as Curators, and not even as the Royal Couple.  But we were most definitely humans from Earth.</p>

<p>"We'd like to speak with the person who runs your facility," we said politely at the entrace, expecting the usual runaround, but we were surprised when minutes later a 19-bit native came to meet us.  The natives of 19-bits have a kind of body covering we had not seen before, which our implants suggested we call "pointils."  They were apparently an intermediate form between a feather and a scale that resembled a short Porcupine quill, and each pointil was in a different color creating a dramatic rainbow effect as he moved.  We all agreed later that sex must be a really interesting affair for them.</p>

<p>"Visitors from Earth?" he bellowed.  "This is an honor.  What can we do for the new inventors of fold technology?"</p>

<p>We allowed as to how we were kind of curious how they were going about our craft, since they seemed to be having some success.  This made him flash a wicked grin which our implants recognized as a friendly smile.  He motioned for us to follow him into the facility.</p>

<p>"It's been a challenge," he said as we made our way to his office.  "The Prometheans don't use nanites, and so their instructions were much more difficult to follow than they needed to be.  It was the natives of CI:174114 who borrowed some of the Promethean tools and developed nanite-based equivalents.  It is their instructions everyone now follows, but just getting a set of directions is still the first bottleneck to building a shop.  They're six thousand pages long and the only machines than can efficiently copy them are made by humans.  Here on 19-bits the three fold shops share a master set."</p>

<p>"How do nanites make things easier?  Aren't nanites the problem with traditional drives?"</p>

<p>"Nanites are a problem when you make the drive <em>out of</em> nanites, but there are a lot of things nanites can get you cheaply that were really hard for the Prometheans.  Standard weights, gauge blocks, some testing machines, all much simpler.  That said, we still have to grind our own lenses for the lithographic optical assemblies and that's highly skilled labor.  Many things like that can only be done the Promethean way."</p>

<p>"We were wondering about skilled labor too," I said carefully.</p>

<p>"It's another bottleneck.  Most people want nothing to do with the rigors of drive manufacture, but it's a big galaxy and we use brokers and labor traders to find people who have the aptitude and desire to do it."</p>

<p>"How do your brokers find them?  And how do you compensate them?"</p>

<p>The manager looked at us.  "Let's have a drink," he said.  We all took small snifters and he poured us a local concoction that reminded me of a pretty good brandy.  "I recognize your friend who isn't saying much," he said.  "He bought our last drive, then turned around and traded it to one of our labor brokers for all the workers she had brought.  Seemed odd at the time.  But then, now I realize, you're human."</p>

<p>We all sipped.</p>

<p>"None of our workers is what you would call a slave.  They all worked hard just to vie for the privilege of being considered for service at a fold shop.  There is nothing in all the galaxy that carries the prestige of making one of these drives.  There is nothing as lasting or as important.  I myself work under an agreement you might consider a form of indentured servitude, and I do so gladly.  There is nothing more worth doing in all the galaxy, at least for those of us who aren't human."</p>

<p>"Who gets the profits from your drive sales?"</p>

<p>"Right now almost everything is plowed into more development and research.  We have learned this from your people, there are always improvements to be made!  But after a good sale we distribute bonuses.  We have feasts.  Some of our people have hobbies which are unheard of elsewhare, such as racing flyers or building intricate models, and their bonuses make it possible for them to acquire materials."</p>

<p>"But who actually owns the shop?"</p>

<p>He smiled.  "Such a human question.  We all own it.  Your people have apparently experimented on occasion with the idea of workers owning their production facility, but for us it is the only way we could consider operating.  And of course the nanite economy means that compensation just isn't that important to most of us; we are guaranteed the means to live just by the fact that we are alive.  The most important compensation most of us receive is our name engraved on the little plaque that is embedded in each drive.  And those signatures are all the same size, the junior apprentice raw glass-wrangler being the same as mine."</p>

<p>"Then why is the term of service so long?" Quentin asked.</p>

<p>"Why should it be short?  We get nobody who really knows very much about what we do.  We have to train them ourselves to do everything.  And we make a point of training everybody to do everything; the glass-wrangler will progress to grinding lenses, to doing actual lithography, to quality assurance, to module assembly.  One day he will be flying the test ship.  As we get new workers to fill in for the jobs she abandons, one day she will be qualified to start her own shop.  That takes awhile though."</p>

<p>"And what if she gets tired of it?"</p>

<p>"That hardly happens, but if it did, as it does very infrequently, we would send her home.  We have no need for a worker who doesn't love the work."</p>

<p>"Would it be possible for us to speak to a few of your people to get a sense of this?"</p>

<p>"Of course.  When I look at the precision you must maintain to make human drives, it just makes me crazy.  How can you do it?  Where we have hundreds of people you must have tens of thousands.  And correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't part of the answer something along the lines of 'let him who will not work, starve?'"</p>

<p>"Yes," Quentin said.</p>

<p>"I am open to any criticism but I fail to see how anything we are doing is worse than <em>that</em>."  He got up and picked a book off of a shelf that appeared mostly to hold technical manuals.  "Your civilization is one of the great accomplishments of galactic history, but it was built on slavery.  Your Greeks and Romans?  Their great civilizations could not have existed without slave labor.  Your United States would not have formed and invented manufacturing without an agreement that slave labor was acceptable.  Same for the Germans who invented your jet engine and extra-atmospheric rocket.  One could make a strong case that your entire civilization is built on coerced service because to this day you do not permit the nanite economy to exist on Earth, and if you cannot find a paying job you have no home or means to feed yourself."</p>

<p>He handed Emma the book.  It was printed in Galactic Common and titled <em>A History of the Humans of Earth.</em>  "Where did you get this?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"It was written by one of the exiles of Seville.  I had to trade two skilled apprentices to one of the other shops to get it.  As I mentioned before, the only machines that can efficiently copy a book are also made by humans, and rather rare away from Earth."</p>

<p>"If we promise to return with five more copies for you, could we borrow this for a day?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"Of course.  That would be a considerable boon."</p>

<p>"We'll be back."</p>

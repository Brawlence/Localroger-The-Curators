<p><em>Four Years Later</em></p>

<p>Our human-form Curator became a regular visitor to our house, particularly after M and I got married.  He revealed himself to the Director who in turn directed us to be his liaison with our species, and to keep it all very quiet.  As far as anyone else knew he was a human engineer who occasionally did contract work for projects at the base.</p>

<p>There were now thousands of raiders permanently living on Earth and hundreds of humans on Kattegat and its new colonies.  While M and I weren't the first human couple to exchange vows on another world the raiders did offer us the opportunity to do it further from home than anyone else would for awhile, on their newest and most distant colony.  Being undeveloped it offered us a honeymoon of exploring and sleeping beneath the stars not too different from our experience when we first met the raiders on the occasion of their surprise attack.  But now the raiders and humans were allies and trading partners and our alliance was considered strong by both sides.</p>

<p>The rest of the galaxy was mostly unthrilled, but there was a sigh of relief on the other side of the galaxy that the raiders didn't seem inclined to do much raiding any more now that they had colonies.  A few races had expressed displeasure that they were getting gifts of technology from us humans that nobody else enjoyed, and one race that in particular spun that feeling to white-hot hatred was the Sevillians, who now blamed themselves for discovering us and bringing us into the galactic community at all.</p>

<p>The raiders had partially repaid us for our generosity with samples of gravity plating, but three years of research had made little progress toward understanding how it worked.  Unlike the fold drive, which all developed races mostly understood, all the raiders or anyone else really knew about gravity plating it was that certain nanites made it work.  So part of our trade was components and raw materials for nanite-based gravity plating.  We were still nervous about setting up nanite based manufacturing on Earth, where it might fall into unreliable hands.</p>

<p>Our Curator knocked precisely at eight on Friday as he'd been doing for over two years.  It's easy to be punctual when you can instantly transport yourself to any place on Earth, or for that matter on numerous other inhabited worlds orbiting other stars.</p>

<p>"I received a communication today," he said as M set out dinner.  "One of our agents on Seville has been observing a construction project they are undertaking in orbit.  It is unusually large for something that hasn't been announced to the general population."  He used his hand to project an image on the wall of our dining room.  It shifted indicating progress over time.  "We are fairly sure this first stage is a fold drive," he said.  "But look what it is now becoming."</p>

<p>The structure built around the fold drive was barely larger than the fold drive and its power source together.  It had no windows or obvious bays.  It was a tiny fraction of the size of any alien fold ship we'd ever seen, though still larger than most human fold ships.  Yet it was taking on an appearance of completion; it did not seem they were planning to build it any bigger.</p>

<p>"They are making two of these.  Sorry about the quality of the images but even with our technology, these are still telescopic images from the ground."</p>

<p>"I wish P were here," M said.  "I'd have an interesting question to ask her about nanite based fold drives."</p>

<p>The Curator smiled.  "Who do you think makes those drives possible?  I can probably answer your question."</p>

<p>"The reason these fold drives can't be remotely controlled is that they have to be carefully calibrated to set the range and aperture, right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you have automated those functions but none of our other children have ever managed to do that."</p>

<p>"But if you wanted to <em>deliberately</em> fold a world into its sun, you just massively detune it, right?  You could automate <em>that</em>."</p>

<p>"The thought had occurred to us," he said, "but we considered it so monstrous that we..."</p>

<p>M dove for the telephone and hit the top speed-dial setting.  "Code ternary burn omaha, get him online <em>now</em>," M said.  A few moments later:  "Director, is the fold span limiter operating?"  Pause.  "Make sure it is online and stays online.  This is the most important thing ever.  I'll explain in a bit."</p>

<p>"Surely you don't think they would really..."</p>

<p>"Those aren't ships," M said very definitely.  "Those are planet killers."</p>

<p>"If you are right it would be... unfortunate."</p>

<p>M poured wine all around.  "Sure I hope I'm wrong," M said, "but I don't think I am.  Remember I have devoted my life to the arts of war.  And J and I have seen what a fold drive can do firsthand.  Humans may not have been in space very long but we've been waging war at sea for centuries.  And those aren't ships or even submarines.  Those are torpedoes."</p>

<p>"Do the Sevillians know we have the fold span limiter?" I asked, genuinely not being in the loop.</p>

<p>"Not by us," M said, and looked at the Curator.  "I am pretty sure they don't know," he said.  "But I only found out about this business a couple of months ago.  Our agent on Seville didn't realize the potential implications until then.  This is still a very large project involving transport of a lot of mass to orbit.  The nanite fold drive itself is a huge solid mass and its construction is much of the difficulty of building even a normal scale fold ship.  To hide something on this scale from the local population is very hard.  Our agent would have missed it if we didn't have a superior ability to detect fold activity."</p>

<p>"The question is how close are these things to completion."</p>

<p>We talked some more, and then the Curator sat up very straight.  "I have just received a communication from our agent on Seville.  The artifacts have disappeared, coincident with the unannounced departure of their fold ship <em>Rate of Change</em>, which was supposedly being refitted."</p>

<p>"That's the submarine," M said as she hit the speed dial again.  "Ternary burn omaha, yeah I know, it's me again.  Director, they're on their way.  Is there any unusual fold activity in the Solar System?"  Pause.  "Okay, we'll be there as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"An alien fold ship just folded into the Oort cloud.  Looks like it's positioning to use Uranus for velocity adjustment.  We need to get to the base."</p>

<p>"I can help with that," the Curator said.  "Hold hands and stand close to me."  We did as instructed.  "You might want to close your eyes."  We did, and when we opened them we were all at the base, in a vacant office near the Director's.</p>

<p>"Do what you have to do," the Curator said.  "I'll be learning what I can.  I'll be in touch."  And he disappeared.</p>

<p>"I thought you were at home," the Director said when we burst into his office.</p>

<p>"We were about a minute ago.  Tonight is our meeting with you-know-who, remember?"</p>

<p>"Okay, this better be good."</p>

<p>Fortunately the Curator had flashed his images over to M's phone.  There was an incoming phone call.  "They're at Uranus.  Looks like they are aiming for Low Earth Orbit in about an hour and a half."</p>

<p>"How can you tell it's LEO?" I asked.  "Why would they bother matching velocity at all?"</p>

<p>"We can tell the vector they're choosing to fall on pretty accurately.  We're not just sensing from Earth.  We have fold monitors at all the gas giants."</p>

<p>"And this is a very expensive weapon for them to make," M added.  "They won't take a chance on it misfiring during a short flyby if they don't have to."</p>

<p>"They put a lot of work into this thing.  We have to make sure that work comes to nothing.  We've got an hour and a half to figure out what to do."</p>

<p>"Go blast them," one of the assistants said.</p>

<p>"They almost certainly have the sunlight cannon themselves now," M said.  "And their ships are a lot better shielded than ours by their sheer mass."</p>

<p>"Do nothing," I said.</p>

<p>Everyone looked at me.</p>

<p>"We have the span limiter and they don't know we have it.  They'll drop their torpedo and run, thinking it will obliterate us a few seconds later.  Then we go up and carve the torpedo up at our leisure."</p>

<p>"I think this is the best strategy," the Director said, and M nodded.  "It's also likely to confuse the attackers because they won't know why their weapon didn't work."</p>

<p>So an hour and a half later we were all still in place when the Sevillian foldship <em>Rate of Change</em> dropped its payload in a stable polar orbit around Earth and then folded off toward, as far as we could tell, nowhere.  Seconds later a klaxon sounded.  "Span limiter activity," one of the assistants shouted.</p>

<p>"What happens when the span limiter limits one of these things?" I asked M.</p>

<p>"It depends on the fold geometry of the detuned drive.  It could fold itself into the Sun, or the fold could just fail."  After a few moments the klaxon blew again.  "It's still up there and it's retrying."</p>

<p>"Well we can't just leave the fucking thing up there," the Director said.  "Any ideas?"</p>

<p>"It's probably otherwise unmanned and unarmed.  I can take <em>Grasshopper</em> and blast it to shreds."</p>

<p>"Those shreds will still be the heaviest things that ever re-entered from orbit eventually.  They could wipe out a city or start a tsunami."</p>

<p>"Well we have the ability to manually adjust the fold aperture radius now, use <em>Grasshopper</em> to fold the whole damn thing back to the Oort cloud."</p>

<p>"The radius of operation of the span limiter is only about an AU.  You fold it too far away from Earth it will fold itself and whatever folded it away into the Sun, along with who knows what else.  Plus we can't be sure how its detuned fold attempts would affect a calibrated fold."</p>

<p>"Maybe we're overthinking this a bit," I said.  "Don't we still have hydrogen bombs?  The thing is less than fifty meters across.  We should be able to <em>vaporize</em> it."</p>

<p>The Director just looked at a guy in uniform who immediately said "On it."  </p>

<p>"Sir, there's another problem," M said.  "The Sevillians built two of these damn things."</p>

<p>"And you think you know what they're going to do with the other one?"</p>

<p>"I would bet a huge pile of money it's on its way to Kattegat."</p>

<p>We were in our comfortable but isolated prison apartment for three more days before there was a knock on the door.  They had never knocked before, and we didn't know how to offer entry, but a screen lit up and told us to just say "Open" in English.  M said "Open" and a single apparently unarmed raider bowed before crossing the threshold.</p>

<p>"Your colors look familiar," I said.  "Weren't you on one of the screens during our presentation?"</p>

<p>"I was indeed, human J.  I am <em>scree</em> the Praetor of Resources.  From our communications we believe your version of me leads what is called your Department of the Interior."</p>

<p>"I thought you were afraid we might have bombs in our clothes," M said.</p>

<p>"Indeed we did.  But our welcome at your world has surpassed our every expectation.  Your people have extended an unimaginable generosity considering how our species met.  And your constructions are said to be awe inspiring.  We were very foolish to risk making you enemies.  And so the two of you now have the same freedom of our world, and I am tasked to be your guide.  Anything you wish to see you may see, anywhere you wish to go you may go, anything you wish to ask will be answered if I can access the answer."</p>

<p>"We don't even know where to begin," I said.</p>

<p>"Truthfully, we know you closely explored the young world Seville, and our technology like most of that in the galaxy is almost exactly the same as theirs.  We just use it a bit differently."</p>

<p>"Tactics," M said.</p>

<p>"Quite so, human M.  I have also been asked to mention that we know that you are the individual who single-handedly defeated our fold ship in battle.  This act commands our deepest respect."  She looked at me.  "And human J, we are told you are the individual who prevailed on your society to extend the generous offer of your help to colonize undeveloped worlds.  We are afraid that this is a debt we may never adequately repay."</p>

<p>"Never attacking us again would be quite adequate repayment," I said.</p>

<p>"My advisors say your facial grimace indicates amusement.  It is an amusing observation.  But we are as fiercely loyal as we are belligerent, and we will not consider mere peace adequate compensation for what you are offering.  We attacked you and then we treated you rudely when you came to us in peace.  We seek to rectify that."</p>

<p>"Do you have any natural wonders you are proud of?" M asked.  "We have seen much on the planets we have explored, but on Earth we find that things like mountains and waterfalls and volcanoes and glaciers inspire us.  As with the technology these might be things found on many worlds, but your examples would be <em>yours</em> and worthy of visiting."</p>

<p>So raider N bowed, and we did a little pocket tour of raider world natural wonders.  Toward the end of the first day I realized I had been hearing <em>scree</em> periodically when she referred to her own world.  "Yes, we are told you are also known for naming worlds in your language," she said.  "Would you care to name ours?"</p>

<p>"I've actually been thinking about it," I said.  "I choose to call your world Kattegat."</p>

<p>"Is there any significance?"</p>

<p>"A thousand years ago there were humans who lived much as your people do, except without space travel it was other humans they raided from the sea.  They are considered among the fiercest warriors our kind ever produced.  Kattegat was the home village of one of their most successful leaders."</p>

<p>N bowed again.  "A name we accept with honor, then," she said.  "How did your ancestors deal with the raiders of Kattegat?"</p>

<p>"They were called Vikings.  Our world was very fractured -- still is actually -- and different people reacted to them differently.  The most successful offered them land to settle and the hospitality of neighbors.  Within a few generations nobody remembered that their ancestors had once been bitter enemies."</p>

<p>"It is not just your constructions that are awe-inspiring," N said.  "It is said that in our deep past we turned against ourselves as you describe, but with our Curation we turned our aggression outward toward other races on other worlds.  But your memory of that era is relatively fresh, and you have applied that same lesson to interstellar relations.  We may have much to learn from you."</p>

<p>We were in something like an airport, and another raider approached us.  His gait was halting and his fur was spotty, and I realized he must have been very old.  "I need to introduce you to this fellow," N said.  "He is one of our most renowned artists."</p>

<p>"If I may," the stranger said.  "Would you extend some part of your bare skin you don't mind if it might be stained for a few <em>scree</em>?"</p>

<p>M and I looked at one another and she said, "Renowned artist, eh?" and stuck out her forearm.  He applied a few dots of color to her skin.  I followed suit.</p>

<p>"I need to make sure there is no irritation, and that the removal process works as intended," he said before retreating.</p>

<p>"What was that about?" M asked when he was gone.</p>

<p>"It could be a very big deal if it is workable," was all N said.</p>

<p>A couple of hours later after we visited an active volcano and returned, the same individual returned and swabbed our skin with what smelled for all the world like rubbing alcohol, and the dots of color came off.  He seemed very satisfied.  "I will see you again soon," he said.</p>

<p>"I did ask what that was about, didn't I?" M said.</p>

<p>"He's an artist.  He now knows he might have a canvas."</p>

<p>The next day N properly introduced us to the colorist.  "You have probably noticed we wear colored patterns in our fur.  We would feel odd -- perhaps as you do without clothes -- without these patterns.  They honor our ancestors and our own accomplishments and proclaim our identity.  Our colors give us courage in battle.  O is our most senior and accomplished colorist.  For years our top leaders would only accept color from him.  <em>scree</em> ago he retired, and hasn't given color for many years.  But he asked us for an audience with you."</p>

<p>The old raider bowed and said, "I humbly request the honor of giving you color," he said.  "It would mean a great deal to my people, particularly those who lost family on the fold ship <em>scree</em>.  Color honors the dead and celebrates victory.  Color cements truce.  We know your ways are very different but for our own people, accepting color would be a great step toward unity between our species."</p>

<p>"So this is what the color daubs were about?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I would not offer this if I thought it would harm you, or considering your ways if I wasn't sure I could remove the color after an appropriate period of time."</p>

<p>"What would you consider an appropriate period of time?"</p>

<p>"A day would be sufficient," O said.  "If you are willing more would honor us."</p>

<p>"Well I'm in," M said without hesitation.  "What about you, J"</p>

<p>"I'm a bit reluctant to..."</p>

<p>"If I might offer a suggestion, it might be useful for one of you to continue to exhibit your modesty habit," N said.  "All of our people will be watching this, and most of them don't know about that."</p>

<p>I glanced back at M and wondered if she realized she wasn't just offering to be naked, she was offering to be naked on planetwide an possibly galactic TV.  But I just said "Could you just color the parts of my body I normally expose, like my face and hands?"</p>

<p>"I can work with that," O said.</p>

<p>Later I said to M, "You do realize that if they broadcast this globally the chances of it eventually reaching Earth are something like one hundred percent."</p>

<p>She shrugged.  "Sure, but I think one of us has to do it, and have you noticed that all the aliens we have met so far have rigid or bony penises?  If you go naked I think you'll end up spending the whole show explaining how your dick works.  And face it, when <em>that</em> got back to Earth it would be a bit more humiliating than me becoming a pinup model."</p>

<p>Two days later we were standing just offstage as we listened to a Kattegat media personality introduce us.  It was weirdly familiar, but also oddly nostalgic because the large cameras and manual controls for everything gave the studio an Earth-1970's feel.  We were given to understand that nearly everyone on the planet was watching, and there was a live audience of several hundred individuals.  M and I both wore mikes and earphones for the translators, which were powered by their vast and deeply buried supercomputer complexes, and M was naked to display the colors O had given her.</p>

<p>"Our visitors from Earth," we heard in our earpieces, and at this cue we walked onstage and bowed toward the host and then toward his audience both in-house and global.</p>

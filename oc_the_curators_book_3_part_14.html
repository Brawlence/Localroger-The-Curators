<p><em>1963</em></p>

<p>Our pact to help the humans of Earth ran into a snag pretty quickly.  We soon
realized that we knew no more about the technologies humans were developing than the
humans did themselves.  We were so far ahead of them that we had completely forgotten
the basic techniques that were precursors of our own vastly superior technology.  So 
we watched with genuine interest as they developed techniques of information processing
that were within their reach to implement.  It turned out that we knew no more about 
nuclear reactions than they did, because nuclear reactions are mostly useless once you
understand how stars evolve and you have the fold.  When the test bomb Castle Bravo ran
away and harmed many of its observers, we were as surprised by the unanticipated side
reaction as its builders.</p>

<p>It did not occur to us that chemically powered missiles could reach space, or
that they could be used to deliver nuclear weapons with hardly any warning, until
the humans demonstrated these things.  As always those who had recruited us pointed
to the resulting hair trigger situation as proof the humans would destroy themselves,
but the thing we observed then was that the humans seemed to be aware of the problem 
too.  When the human mathematician John Nash proved that the hair trigger could 
be made more stable, few offworld Curators could even understand his argument.</p>

<p>There was a period when our biggest worry was that an accidental failure might set
off the hair trigger despite the stabilizing influences humans had inserted into
their control systems.  We did make preparations to throw the biggest spanner we
could into the gears of their nuclear command structure if we had to, but there 
were only six of us and it was a massive enterprise.  Fortunately we broke lucky
and they began drawing down their overkill capability before anything like that 
had a chance to happen.  They did come close a couple of times.  We were prepared to
intervene in the event they came to call the Cuban Missile Crisis, since there were
only a few ships and missile installations directly involved, but it turned out 
that the humans present managed to avert the danger on their own.</p>

<p>We did not understand the dangers of nuclear energy because we had never had need
to try to make use of it, and so the contamination and reactor accidents took us
by surprise too.  We also took note that they were altering their world's climate 
-- that was something we <em>did</em> understand -- but we could think of no way to alter
their behavior without effectively Curating them.</p>

<p>Since there was a gradually evolving understanding among humans that making big war
would be at best ineffective, the powers of Earth pursued other ways to gain influence
and assert their geopolitical positions.  The global superpowers interfered ruthlessly
in the affairs of smaller nations, and as much as they dared with each others'
politics through propaganda, blackmail, and other methods.</p>

<p>And like most humans who were alive then all six of us remember where we were on 
November 22, 1963 when we got the news that the popular and inspirational American
president had been assassinated.</p>

<p><em>Present Day</em></p>

<p>Callie acquired a motorcycle and often when the <em>Palomino</em> was in orbit, meaning her
services would not be needed, she would ride it to the outskirts of Sydney so as not to
lead any fold effect snoops to her lair and her starship truck, unlock her implant's
fold drive, and fold over to Denver to visit Veronica.  The first few times she did
this her clothes did not make the trip with her, but learning to overcome that bug 
was one of the reasons for visiting.  That and the other thing; Veronica and I were
also occasionally intimate, and she made it no secret that her voyage to the Pinwheel
with Callie had involved more than just small talk.</p>

<p>For the first few years after the ultimatum in the major human population centers it
felt like little was happening.  But those of us who were in a position to do something
useful were furiously busy.  Her experience selecting moons made Sofia something of a
goddess of the new school of DENT world design.  DENT was a blank slate that could make
almost any environment habitable, but it was also a glove that had to be slipped over
an existing world.  At some point someone had to decide where to put the cities, whether
to use a basin for a lake, and how to skirt the mountain ranges.  Nanites could do a 
lot but they weren't good at making that kind of decision.  Sofia was training
others as she learned the craft herself; while there might only be a half dozen new
worlds so far, eventually the evacuation goal was to make a thousand, and their 
number would grow exponentially as the new bulk nanoassembly and nanite manufactories
came online.</p>

<p>The <em>Palomino</em> was now always fully booked on voyages to the Pinwheel, and plans were being
laid to start shuttling the <em>Bellerophon</em> and the <em>Limiting Factor</em> too.  This still 
wasn't enough to make even a small dent in our evacuation needs; we would have to build 
a thousand giant fold ships too to get the job done in a century.  But that's what
nanites are for.</p>

<p>Most of the people who came to the Pinwheel at this early stage were old, and they came
to get the Cure before it was too late.  The news that emigration would also confer
effective immortality made the program very popular, and while there was some grumbling
that we should stay and fight it was minimal.  We also got word that this astonished and
infuriated the Curators, but our deal had said nothing about mortality.</p>

<p>About a year after the Mauna Kea summit I was doing my usual vigil as the <em>Palomino</em>
arrived and a familiar face appeared out of the crowd.  It was the new Keeper of
Amplifiers who had accepted our treaty offer -- and he didn't seem to have an amplifier.
He recognized me and came over.</p>

<p>"Did you forget something?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh no, I promise I am simply here as a tourist.  Your government said that was okay."</p>

<p>"It is indeed.  We are not ashamed of anything we are doing here.  Care for a coffee?"</p>

<p>I showed him the city from the cafe overlook.  "Not too impressive," I admitted, "But
it's home."</p>

<p>"Oh it's very impressive," the Keeper said as he sipped his mocha.  "Maybe not so
much for <em>what</em> it is, but definitely for <em>where</em> it is."  He pointed up at the 
moon, which people had taken to calling Aqua Bella.  "Is your moon habitable?  I
can't imagine that your people would be able to resist the temptation to try."</p>

<p>"Not yet, but you're right, there are plans."</p>

<p>"You will need every habitable square centimeter if you're giving everyone the Cure."</p>

<p>"I can't speak of other races, but it's well documented that human fertility drops
a great deal when we are prosperous.  At this point we don't think 
imposed population control will be immediately necessary.  And of course the Cure 
doesn't extend our early fertile period by much unless drastic interventions 
are made, so we don't see a short-term exponential crisis unfolding."</p>

<p>"We'll see," he said with another sip.  "I was wondering if there might be any
chance of catching up with my predecessor."</p>

<p>"We don't know exactly where he is," I lied.  "I do know he is still alive because
the way I sabotaged his implant it would return here if his host dies."  This 
happened to be true.</p>

<p>"Why did you let him live if you killed our other agent?"</p>

<p>"He had honor.  His beliefs were erroneous but he was acting on them out of duty.
The other agent was positively ready to splooge itself waiting for the Earth to
disappear as it watched out the window of a fold ship bar in orbit."</p>

<p>"I can see how that would have annoyed you."</p>

<p>"Immensely."</p>

<p>"We cannot figure out how you got the knowledge to do things like stealing our
amplifiers or sabotaging our implants.  Not that I expect you to tell me.  There
are some among us who are terrified about it."</p>

<p>"Worry would be justified," I said, "but only if you keep provoking us.  We have
no quarrel with you.  We recognize your claim to the Milky Way as your garden and
now that we understand how important it is to you, we intend to respect it."</p>

<p>"I appreciate that," he said, and I noted that he had not said <em>we</em>.</p>

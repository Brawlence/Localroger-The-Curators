<p>I had never been much of a camper, but M had to take a geologist on a mission to another world and our newest starship was scheduled to arrive within a day.  I awoke to the droning of the C130's turboprop engines.  I kicked the switch that turned on the battery powered LED landing lights and got out of the tent in time to see a row of parachutes blossom in the morning sky.</p>

<p>The <em>Boxcar</em> couldn't land yet, having no landing strip, but that was also the purpose of this mission.  As it popped off into the first fold back home, the last of the parachutes to emerge from the plane turned out to be lighter and more maneuverable than those floating pallets of tools and materials to the surface.  One of those landed near me and the serviceman saluted me as he advanced.  "Sir, are you Ambassador J?" he asked earnestly.</p>

<p>"Son, we are eighty light-years from the Earth, and my pilot is both female and on another mission, so that's kind of an obvious thing," I said dryly.</p>

<p>A few minutes later his commanding officer got to me.  "Ambassador," he said simply with an outstretched hand, which I shook vigorously.</p>

<p>"We are going to build you the finest damn airstrip this planet has ever seen," he said with a sharklike grin.</p>

<p>"I appreciate that, but I hope you realize that's kind of a low bar to clear."  We both laughed and he turned around.  "Men, let's get the quarters raised.  The Ambassador is probably tired of sleeping on the ground and eating MRE's."</p>

<p>Within a couple of hours they had a large tent erected, and were populating it with folding beds and tables.  These were Seabees, the Navy's Construction Battalion, and they were doing what they had done on every corner of the Earth for nearly a hundred years.</p>

<p>A few hours later I was being asked to address the men.  "Ambassador J, have you chosen a name for this place?" the Admiral asked.</p>

<p>"I have," I said.  "Welcome to the world of Providence."</p>

<p>There was applause.  "So are we under the protection of God as we do our work here?" he asked a little later.</p>

<p>"That's not actually why I chose the name," I said, but I didn't explain it just then.</p>

<p>The men fanned out.  There were both a small river and a limestone formation nearby, which were the main reasons our geologist chose this location for our first off-Earth project.  The Seabees had brought everything else necessary to make a concrete airstrip.  The process was scheduled to take about two weeks.</p>

<p>"<em>Boxcar</em> seems like a rather prosaic name for our second starship," the Admiral said as we were dishing out a welcome meal of fried chicken and mashed potatoes.</p>

<p>"Does it now," I said.  "You know there was once a guy named Fred Bock who was commander of a B-29 in World War Two.  His craft was named <em>Bock's Car</em> and that was what was painted on its nose.  And while Bock didn't pilot the mission, that was the plane that Charles Sweeney commanded to drop our second atomic bomb, Fat Man, on the city of Nagasaki.  And let's face it, it's a cargo craft, so it basically is an airborne boxcar."</p>

<p>The next day I heard a familiar engine scream and <em>Grasshopper</em> landed near to our original small tent.  I introduced M and her geologist to the Seabees, and we had turkey and dressing for dinner.</p>

<p>The <em>Boxcar</em> returned about three times a day to drop more supplies by parachute.  Eventually the airstrip began to emerge, starting as a rough area graded by a couple of small all-terrain machines.  Within a week the concrete plant was making Portland cement, the grinder was making and sorting aggregate, and the batcher was mixing it all with water from the nearby stream to make concrete.</p>

<p>M had to go home for a report and offered to take me with her, but I wanted to see the airstrip construction through to completion.  As it turned out she was back before the airstrip was done.  But it was well on its way, a flat strip of hard surface that would be over three thousand meters long when it was ready.  The <em>Boxcar</em> kept returning and dropping parachutes and generators, lighting, and painting supplies were added to our kit.</p>

<p>There was also wine and whiskey, and after a few days the Admiral asked me over dinner the inevitable question.  "Why Providence?"</p>

<p>"Well it's the capital of Rhode Island," I said.</p>

<p>"And of the fifty states, you chose to honor Rhode Island by naming our first interstellar colony after its capital?"</p>

<p>"Providence was founded by Roger Williams after he got kicked out of Massachusetts," I said.  "It was the first place where actual religious freedom was practiced in the New World.  Before Williams, all the colonies were founded as theocracies."</p>

<p>"That's pretty good.  Williams must have been one forward looking person."</p>

<p>I actually snorted my bourbon.  "Oh, on the contrary," I said laughing out loud.  "Roger Williams was one of the most horribly stubborn fundamentalists ever to live.  He believed literally that only 144,000 people could ever get into Heaven.  He was kicked out of Massachusetts because the other Puritans considered him too extreme."</p>

<p>Several seconds of awkward silence.  Then the Admiral asked, "Well then why did you name this world for his capital?"</p>

<p>"He reasoned that if God had placed his chosen few in the midst of so many of the damned, that it must mean that God must have meant for the chosen to find a way to live in peace among the damned.  It meant that even the natives and other heathens should be taken seriously.  Williams is the reason religious freedom was written into the Constitution of the United States.  Not because he believed all religion was valid, but because he believed it was his duty to live in peace among those damned to Hell."</p>

<p>As I finished saying that I saw glasses being lifted into the air.  "To Providence then," a lot of men said in unison, and I raised my glass to join them.</p>

<p>The next day <em>Boxcar</em> finally landed on the world of Providence, and was followed shortly by the <em>City of New Orleans</em>, another starship that had once been a C130 but unlike the <em>Boxcar</em> was fitted for passenger rather than cargo service.</p>

<p>One of the men who got off the <em>New Orleans</em> was an Army General.  "You need to keep thinking of names," he said with a chuckle.  "We're looking to buy a few surplus Boeing 747's."</p>

<p>"I thought those had mostly been retired from service," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, they have.  But the use case for them as long distance aircraft on Earth isn't nearly as good as that for them as fold drive starships."</p>

<p>Later that evening I wandered out onto the airstrip and realized that it was really a lot larger then necessary for a C130.  The military guys were thinking ahead of the game and out of the box.  This first airstrip humans ever built on another world was one that could readily accommodate a Boeing 747.</p>

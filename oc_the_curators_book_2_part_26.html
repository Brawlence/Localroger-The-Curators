<p>The Red Prince hosted our meeting with the leaders of the four political parties that had once been the governments of separate nation-states at his sprawling Australian estate.  Our implants would warn us if any of the dozen or so Curators resident on Earth tried to use their own implants to surveil us, but we were safer from conventional electronic snooping on Red's home turf.</p>

<p>The leader of the Yakuza party currently occupied the rotating position of chief executive, but that position was almost as ceremonial as mine and Emma's were as royalty since hardly anything could be done without the agreement of a plurality in the combined legislature.  Two of our guests had been among those we had abducted to encourage the unification of Earth's government.  There were no hard feelings though, and we all took a shot of fine Australian Scotch to toast each others' continued good fortune.</p>

<p>After a little small talk, Red got to the point.  "How many of the idle great foldships of the diaspora could we make disappear without raising too much notice?" he asked.</p>

<p>The chief executive nodded toward the Australian Party leader.  "Those fellows generally take care of the fleet," he said.</p>

<p>"About ten of them are parked very publicly and open for tours.  Several of those are in large lots where others are visible, so that's about thirty that would definitely be noticed by someone.  There are ten more that were left with the colonies, also for public tours and the occasional odd transportation job.  And there's a population of space nerds who are obsessed with fold ships who sometimes visit the remote yards which are supposed to be closed, and it's kind of hard to hide a kilometer tall ship.  So depending on how quiet you need to keep it, that leaves the eight on the Moon if you can't come up with a cover story."</p>

<p>Red looked at us.  "Jay, Emma?"</p>

<p>"We need at least four," Emma said.</p>

<p>"One of the ones on the Moon is regularly visited by the colonists, but the others are pretty well isolated.  With fold tech to go to habitable places there was never a really good reason for a large lunar colony; they're mostly there to do research that can't be done on the Earth.  Those ships were among the first that we mothballed as the diaspora wound down and for awhile they were used by the colonists, but then abandoned for more diversified underground accommodations as science needs mandated."</p>

<p>"How long will you need them?" the Executive asked.</p>

<p>"You won't be getting them back.  And we will also need to take the nanoassembly research team you've assembled at Melbourne.  I would suggest a cover story about closing their expensive institute due to disappointing progress."</p>

<p>"In one sense you're not asking for anything we can't give you," the Executive said.  "But in another sense you're asking for quite a lot with no explanation."</p>

<p>"The less you know about what we're up to the better," Red said.  "My King and Queen have given me a quest, which I have accepted.  You know their powers.  And you know me by long association.  You know I would not ask a thing like this if there was not a <em>very</em> good reason.  And I will offer you a trade which might not be even, but which I think will impress upon you all how serious this is.  I will donate this estate and all of its contents to your government.  You see, I do not anticipate returning from this quest to settle here again."</p>

<p><em>That</em> got their attention.  "Red, this is your home," the Western Party representative said.</p>

<p>"Sometimes home has to move.  A lot of us learned that the hard way when the ice caps melted."</p>

<p>"Is that what this is?  Is it that serious?"  The Executive looked at me and Emma.  "My God, is it the <em>Curators</em>?"</p>

<p>Red looked at the Australian leader.  "You once gave a fine speech about how it isn't in our nature to stand comfortably in second place.  Well Jay and Emma are Curators themselves now, and in that role they have learned something important.  Something we honestly can't share with you.  But it is something that informs us that we <em>can't afford</em> to stand in second place -- and also affords us a possibility of getting out of second place much sooner than you might imagine."</p>

<p>"You two once took me to a place known only by a number I swore I would never think of again," the Executive said.  "It was CI:915402.  You showed mercy and did not kill me even though I would have killed you if I could have.  Is it this power which is in play?  Is it this power against which we might find ourselves in conflict?"</p>

<p>"It is," Emma said gently.  "And it is this power which, if we succeed, you might own yourself one day, within your expected lifetime."</p>

<p>"Give them the ships," the Yakuza leader said.</p>

<p>Two other leaders mumbled agreement and looked at the Australian.</p>

<p>"You said you need four ships; I think we can give you six in total secrecy, and we don't honestly need them back.  I assume you will also be keeping the <em>Nostromo</em>, and we can find a way to cover that.  Evacuating the nanoassembly institute will be more difficult.  That's five hundred scientists and enough equipment to make fold drives.  The people have families, careers, entanglements.  It will be impossible to hide that they have all disappeared at once."</p>

<p>"We don't need them all, and we don't really need the equipment; it would speed our project along at the beginning but really not by very much.  But we need at least forty out of a list of a hundred of the scientists which we could prepare," Emma said.</p>

<p>"I have an idea," Red said, and after he made his case we finished off the Scotch with another toast.</p>

<p>The interviews were delicate, because we had to be certain our offer would be accepted before we told the nanoassembly researchers enough to give away our game.  But the United States had once made far more people disappear into the southwestern desert to build the first atomic bomb.  Red brought in psychology and propaganda experts who crafted a strategy for us, without knowing even themselves exactly what the actual project was.</p>

<p>Some of the scientists were crossed off of our list without even interviewing them.  Those that had dependent children or intimately connected large extended families we let be.  We also crossed off those that had strong ties to ongoing projects in other venues.  For those we chose to interview, we learned <em>everything</em> about them -- and when you have Curator powers, <em>everything</em> goes a bit deeper than you might realize.  We knew about their affairs, their failing marriages, their sexual proclivities, their gambling debts, and their secret machinations to leapfrog their peers.  We knew exactly what to offer them to make sure that when we told them they might not come home for twenty years, they wouldn't care.</p>

<p>And in the end we noisily and publicly invited the ones who accepted our offer to a symposium in Hawai'i.  On the suborbital supergravity transport, one at a time Emma and I clasped their hands and folded them to the great fold ship <em>Palomino</em> which was parked on a surprisingly scenic ridge overlooking the Bay of Rainbows in the Moon's Jura Mountains.  Finally it was just me and the pilot, who was one of Zeke's crew from Terra Nova.  He set the explosive device to blow in 90 seconds.</p>

<p>"What about the black boxes?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nobody bothers with those any more.  They'll know it was a bomb.  They might even figure out it was set by the pilot; that's what I'm making it look like if they find enough pieces to do an investigation.  But if I ever even come back to Earth, by that time nobody will even remember that this happened.  And nobody will be surprised that there are no bodies."</p>

<p>I folded him to the ship in the Jura Mountains, and a minute later the transport was blown apart at an altitude of a hundred and seventy kilometers over the South Pacific with a tragic loss of fifty-two passengers and crew.</p>

<p>Within a week the <em>Palomino</em> was joined at Terra Nova by the <em>Jupiter 2</em>, the <em>Limiting Factor</em>, the <em>Bellerophon</em>, the <em>Ypres</em>, the <em>Long Shot</em>, and the <em>Far Star</em>.  We landed all of them on the surface of Terra Nova's stabilizing moon.  You might think this a bit bold, putting such big things in plain sight should a Curator wander by to have a look-see, but we had learned an interesting thing about the Curators while working with them.</p>

<p>The Curators don't have remote sensing instruments.  Everything they do is fold based.  Humans built multiple space telescopes, gravity wave observatories, interferometers at every wavelength, and sent probes to peek at close range at all the worlds of our solar system even when that involved impractical chemical rockets.  Curators don't do any of that.  The Curators learned <em>from humans</em> that the Andromeda galaxy is on course to collide with the Milky Way in a billion years or so.  The collisions of black holes and neutron stars in the far reaches of the cosmos as revealed by gravity waves do not interest them.  And similarly, a handful of small extra mountains on a remote moon would not attract their notice unless they were regularly using fold technology.</p>

<p>They would, of course, eventually be regularly using fold technology -- but by that time it wouldn't matter any more if the Curators noticed our project.</p>

<p>Ironically it was the biology guys whose hardware made it possible to bootstrap the mech guys's nanoassembly lab.  The Curators' original nanoassembly tech had been heavily influenced by biology, and made extensive use of custom-designed proteins to deliver programmed sequences of heavy elements where they were needed, much as cellular mechanisms read DNA to create more proteins.  The Ancestors had put a great deal of research into those protein based assembly machines, perhaps centuries, but we didn't have to repeat the effort.  We knew all of their structures already, and how to use them.</p>

<p>Of course those biological mechanisms are fragile and not very reliable and impose all kinds of environmental restrictions on how you can do assembly, but that didn't matter because we also knew just what to use them to build next.  What we called the hard nanoassemblers didn't have any of the biological limitations; they could operate in vacuum, underwater, or under intense radiation flux.  In fact they operated best with lots of ultraviolet light to power them.  Once we had hard nanoassemblers we didn't need the proteins any more and the bio people went back to working on mortality.</p>

<p>One of the things we did once we had the tools was to disassemble the Curator nanites to see what made them tick.  They were on the large side for what they were meant to do, and we were now able to establish that they were meant to enforce several kinds of hard limit on their use, as well as implementing the back door we had seen on Seville which could be used to make nanite constructions disintegrate on command.</p>

<p>We would use nanites; they were a very useful tool.  But ours would be half the size of the Curators' version, and would not be backdoored.</p>

<p>The labs rapidly expanded and with seven ships there was plenty of room for them, although that wasn't the reason we had taken the ships.</p>

<p>Eventually we made the most awkward call.  We hadn't seen the human form Curator in nearly a year, and while we knew it was dangerous neither Emma nor I could stand the idea of ghosting him as we laid our plans.  We felt he would understand.  And we had known him for a very long time.  He showed up to our cabin on the <em>Nostromo</em> with a liter of fine Anejo tequila.</p>

<p>"I was wondering if you would ever tell me what you were hiding from me," he said by way of introduction.</p>

<p>"There is something we need to show you," Emma said.  She held up her hand as she had when we reported the assassination attempt, and he replied in kind.  But this time she simply unlocked all his blocks, as the period of emulation had unlocked mine and I had then unlocked hers.</p>

<p>"Oh my," he said, and he sat down heavily.  I brought shot glasses and he silently poured.  "My friends," he said raising his glass, and we clinked them in toast.</p>

<p>"My human host was a four year old boy," he said, and we realized that we had never, ever heard him or any other Curator talk about the process of switching bodies.  "He had been mauled by a predator and his body was ravaged by infection, and his tribe abandoned him, leaving him behind to die as they moved on.  This was over sixty thousand Earth years ago and I can't blame them, since they had no way to help him."</p>

<p>"He had already formed all the most useful imprints for living in a human body and hadn't yet formed any of the ones that would interfere with the dominance of my personality.  There is, of course, a little of him in me though.  Engram synchronization always works both ways.  We prefer to take young hosts so that an existing personality intereferes as little as possible with our Curator legacy."</p>

<p>"I was moved to CI:201442, a world populated by a race of mammals much like yourselves, to wait for my body to mature.  Since humans weren't Curated the assignment to live among you was one a lot of us didn't want, but I was relatively young; I had had less than twenty hosts, and was barely a million years old.  Humans represented a new and unknown challenge."</p>

<p>"I suppose this body has had an effect on me though.  We are taught to block the strong emotions of our hosts and never to befriend those we Curate.  But I am glad I broke that rule.  You may not appreciate just what you have stumbled into.  Indeed it is sweet that in the very process of trying to destroy you that <em>scree</em> gave you the keys to everything we ever made.  I am realizing things I was never allowed to know myself.  Some things just forgotten, some obviously buried to prevent you from doing what you are about to do.  And some whose significance you won't realize for awhile."</p>

<p>Emma spoke.  "We wanted to know what you think your people will do about it," she said.</p>

<p>"If they knew, they would feel just as my host did in the hours after his tribe left him and it got dark and he began to realize he was truly alone.  They would panic.  They would lash out with all their power and they would not worry too much about what they might be destroying in the process."</p>

<p>"We were kind of afraid of that," I said.</p>

<p>"Which is why I can't tell them," he said to our immense relief.</p>

<p>"Eventually we will realize our project and it will become impossible to hide," Emma said.</p>

<p>"I worry about that.  I suspect you are chasing both the mortality cure and implants of your own?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Mortality is not a big problem.  The Witnesses have caused a bit of trouble by the fact of their existence but we know that can be controlled.  If you make implants for all of yourselves though..."  He finished his shot and poured another.  "There are only a few tens of millions of us.  We have never been very numerous.  There is a slight rate of attrition as some of us tire of the game and retreat into the world of our implants, and new Curators are recruited to replace them, but it is slight.  If we suddenly confront a race of billions all with our same capabilities, you will annihilate us."</p>

<p>"That isn't our intention," I said.</p>

<p>"Even my human host at the age of four would have recognized the stupidity of trusting that," he said.</p>

<p>"We offer a promise though," Emma said, and she told the Curator our plan.  As she spoke his mood softened and he nodded.</p>

<p>"I will keep your secret," he said.  "And even if I didn't, those who matter would have no problem with what you plan to do.  If you can remain undiscovered until you are in a position of relative strength, and you follow through with your plan, I do not believe there will be a conflict between our peoples."</p>

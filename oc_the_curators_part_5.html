<p>While we were still falling through the gravity well of one of the Seville system's gas giants in order to match velocity for Seville orbit, I invited K to my stateroom and showed it the phone.  "You asked me a question on my last visit and I wasn't able to answer," I said.  "This time I brought the answer."  I navigated to the phone's video gallery and queued up a documentary on the manufacture of modern integrated circuits.</p>

<p>K's dermis was brown when the video started but slowly turned dark red, then bright red, as it watched.  K made a gesture and I demonstrated the touch control to pause the playback.</p>

<p>"How is this thing getting video data from Earth?"</p>

<p>"It isn't.  It's self-contained."</p>

<p>"You have an <em>entire video</em> stored in a device this size?"</p>

<p>"It's much worse than that.  I flipped the phone over and popped the cover, revealing the memory chip the size of a human fingernail.  "This video, and about a hundred more, are stored in <em>that</em>."</p>

<p>"How in the cosmos is this possible?"</p>

<p>"The video you are watching explains that."</p>

<p>K started watching again.  Silicon plates were cut, polished, vacuum deposited, exposed, etched, rinsed.  And then it was done again, with slightly different chemicals.  And again.  And again.  K paused the video.</p>

<p>"How accurately do these things have to be registered each time they put them back in the vacuum chamber?"</p>

<p>"It's in the video intro, but I think this is a twenty nanometer process.  So quite a bit less than that, obviously.  They use optical methods, in this case with ultraviolet light to keep the wavelength as short as possible."</p>

<p>"And they do this how many times?"</p>

<p>"The video explains it.  I think there are about thirty steps in this process."</p>

<p>"<em>AND THIS WORKS?</em>"</p>

<p>"You are holding the result in your hands."</p>

<p>K finished the video, its dermis almost glowing flourescent green by the time it was done.  "How many of these machines can your species produce?"</p>

<p>"Just about every one of us gets a new one every year or two as they improve."</p>

<p>"But that means you must make billions of them, by this convoluted and insane process!"</p>

<p>"And we do just that.  The plant where those chips are made cost over a billion dollars to build, and it's just one of many that are necessary to make these devices."</p>

<p>"The penalty did not translate."</p>

<p>I thought about it a bit.  "It represents the directed effort of tens of thousands of humans, focused on nothing else, for at least a year."</p>

<p>I recognized that it was K's turn to be thoughtful.  "How on Earth do you get your people to put in that kind of effort to make things like this?"</p>

<p>"We give them tokens which they can exchange for things like this, called <em>money</em>.  You need money for other things which your people seem to take for granted, so my people are motivated to do what they can to get a supply.  K, I know you were one of the negotiators dealing most frequently with my people, didn't we tell you about any of this?"</p>

<p>"No.  Nothing like this.  Nothing about this system you have ... do you mean that basic life necessities like food and water are tied to this <em>money</em> system?"</p>

<p>I nodded, a gesture I knew K understood.  "We call it capitalism.  It's been pretty successful."</p>

<p>"It sounds distressingly coercive."</p>

<p>"Well, truthfully, it is.  But nobody gave us the gifts your people got, so we had to come up with something.  Come to think of it, I have no idea where your technology comes from either."</p>

<p>"We hid nothing from your people.  We assumed your leaders would inform you."</p>

<p>"On Earth that's not always a good assumption.  I've shown you mine K, how can I learn about your technology?"</p>

<p>"I know exactly who you need to talk to."</p>

<p>Two days later the foldship had made orbit, the shuttle had taken us to the surface, and K was introducing me to one of Seville's top nanite assembly researchers.  The walls of the office were lined with what seemed to be electron micrographs.  We started the meeting by letting it watch the video on my phone.</p>

<p>"This is remarkable," it said.  "K has alerted me to this device's prodigous memory capacity, but how is it powered?"</p>

<p>"Chemical battery," I said.  I popped the cover and showed it.  "It's dying though, at about fifty percent capacity.  I brought a device which can recharge it but it needs a source of very bright light, like sunshine."</p>

<p>"Oh, we can accommodate you for that," the researcher said.  "It has never occurred to anyone in millions of years to try anything like the production effort this video portrays.  The number of ways for things to go wrong would simply be seen as silly, and using nanites is so much easier."</p>

<p>"I brought him here so he can see our methods," K said.</p>

<p>"Ah.  Well, behold."  It led me to one of the wall posters and tapped it.  "This is a single nanite, possibly the greatest gift of the Curators since we became sapient."  It was a cube with some patterns on its sides.</p>

<p>"Is that an electron micrograph?  How big is it?"</p>

<p>After some dickering with the translator we established that yes, it was a scanning electron micrograph, and the nanite was about four hundred nanometers on edge.  "A single nanite isn't good for much though," the researcher said.  "Here is the simplest structure we know of which can create more nanites.  It consists of about five hundred nanites itself, and it doesn't actually do anything with the nanites it creates, although other processes can use them."</p>

<p>"What does it use as raw materials?"</p>

<p>"Ultraviolet light for energy, silicon dioxide which it separates into oxygen and silicon, and trace elements dissolved in a surrounding fluid.  It's not hard to arrange.  Our immature young are encouraged to make a nanite nursery as part of their education."</p>

<p>"And what can they do?"</p>

<p>"They can be electronic amplifying or digital computation elements, or structural elements.  They can store electrical energy and emit light.  Practical assemblies require hundreds of thousands, millions, or even more nanites, but arbitrarily large numbers of them can be self-assembled from simple materials as part of a larger construction process.  Most of our buildings are made of them, since it's so much easier to let the building build itself than to maneuver heavy materials into place."</p>

<p>I had noticed that for all their high tech, neither Seville nor Pompeii had buildings higher than ten or fifteen stories.  "What's the tensile strength of a block of nanites?"</p>

<p>After more dickering with the translator we established it was about four thousand PSI.  "Our structural steel is about ten times stronger than that," I said.</p>

<p>"But what do you have to do to make it?"</p>

<p>"We melt it."</p>

<p>"What's it made of?"</p>

<p>"Iron and nickel."  I had been thinking of information technology and had not thought to bring a video of a foundry or steel mill.</p>

<p>"You <em>melt metals</em> in quantities large enough to make a <em>building</em>?"</p>

<p>"All the time."</p>

<p>"I suppose this takes the directed coordination of thousands of humans too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's kind of how we do everything.  Surely you have things that aren't made of nanites?"</p>

<p>"Well, obviously we can't eat them but much of our agriculture is run by machines that are made of them.  They are capable of precise positioning and selective chemical selection so we can use them to make plastics and other chemicals, and we use those for most things nanites are a bit rough or overkill for, such as pipes and utensils."</p>

<p>"Tell me something.  Your young can make nanites, can they make advanced things with them?"</p>

<p>"If they want to.  The designs are openly available."</p>

<p>"What about the fold drive?"</p>

<p>"Well of course, it's made of nanites.  It takes a lot of them but it's not hard to get a lot of nanites.  Of course there's not much point making a fold drive on the surface of the planet since you'd fold off a pretty big crater if you tried to use it."</p>

<p>"And the fold drive can fold your world into its star by accident."</p>

<p>"Well the Curators gave us the configuration constants, so there's no danger of that for us."</p>

<p>"What if someone decided to do it deliberately?"</p>

<p>"Well nobody would do that because it would be suicide."</p>

<p>I decided that was probably a good place to say "Okay, thanks," and end the conversation.  There were obvously a <em>lot</em> of things my fellow humans had not told these folks about us.</p>

<p>Later K presented at my door with a container of something called Royal Salute, which turned out to be another stupidly expensive Scotch they could easily duplicate from a few sample drops.  "You are hiding something," K accused correctly.</p>

<p>"You've learned a lot about us," I said trying to deflect.</p>

<p>"You're trying to deflect," K said.</p>

<p>Dealing with totally honest people is really a strange but also addictive thing.  "Some of my people would deliberately use the fold drive to kill us all," I said."</p>

<p>"Oh, we've known that for a few years."</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem like anyone I've dealt with except you knows this."</p>

<p>"We really don't know what to do about it, and it is kind of terrifying.  Many of your people are brilliant and noble but many others are very ill."</p>

<p>I nodded gravely.  "Maybe we should blame the Curators for ignoring us."</p>

<p>K held up its glass in the gesture it had learned from me.  I met it with mine and clinked.  "We have no idea why you were denied," K said, "but everyone among us thinks it was wrong.  It has left you with challenges we cannot imagine -- and you have met those challenges with solutions we could not imagine either."</p>

<p>"That will be a great thing to know if humanity survives this."</p>

<p>"It is not your race I worry about," K said to my surprise.  "I am what your people call a <em>diplomat</em>.  I have traveled the galaxy and met members of thousands of species.  We all have the same nanites, the same fold drive, the same moon stabilizing our world.  We all breathe oxygen and are built by DNA.  As different as our species are, you and I share at least fifty percent the same DNA because of the Curators."  K tossed back its drink, and I realized it had been drinking quite a bit before it came to my room.</p>

<p>"Are you all right?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I don't think any of us are all right right now," K replied.  "As far as we have always known nanites and the fold drive are the peak achievements of technology.  This has been the case for close to eight billion of your Earth years.  We have no idea what the Curators might have held out on us.  After all, they must have somehow made the first few nanites.  I never really thought about that much until you showed me the fabrication video.  At some point the Curators must have been like you.  After all, nobody Curated them either."</p>

<p>K kicked back its drink and quietly exited.  And I realized, having studied its species, that its violet dermis meant K had just said goodbye.  I would never see K again.</p>

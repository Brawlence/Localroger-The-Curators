<p>After losing consciousness in the ruptured hab I woke up on the floor of a large, brightly lit nanite based building.  It wasn't decorated and had the feel of a public work which wouldn't often have random visitors.  There was a large display showing a grid of mostly green indicators, with a few red ones sprinkled about.  As I watched one of the red indicators turned green.</p>

<p>Opposite this display the roof vaulted upward to join a wall which undulated like an array of cylinders.  Each of these undulations carried some lettering in Galactic Common; the nearest one said:</p>

<p><em>Falling Tower 12-4-29-20</em></p>

<p>That sign hadn't been placed by human or alien operators; it had been embedded in the surface of the wall by the nanites that built it.  This was a power plant, the classic nanite based style which worked by folding large magnetic weights to the top of towers to fall past pickup coils.  As I worked this out I heard footsteps and turned to find Emma approaching from the connecting hallway.</p>

<p>"Welcome back," she said.  "I woke up about half an hour ago.  The natives are here and they're a bit restless."  As she said this one of the natives followed her into the control room.  It was a Sevillian, and its dermis was bright green indicating confusion.</p>

<p>"Do you know why the moon is on fire?" it asked as if it could not believe it was asking such a ridiculous thing.</p>

<p>"I didn't know the moon was on fire," I said.  "I don't know why I'm here at all."</p>

<p>"The power plant was abandoned when we were exiled and it stopped working.  Today it came to life and we came here to investigate.  We found you here in the control room.  We thought you might be dead but now you've awakened.  While you were still unconscious the moon rose and it was on fire."</p>

<p>We took an elevator to the roof.  The sky was dark and the quarter moon was fully covered with glowing debris.  It was thickest and brightest toward the northeastern quadrant, suggesting that the source of the disturbance was over the lunar horizon in that direction.</p>

<p>"What in the hell could do that?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"Three hundred kilograms of ice impacting at one hundred thousand kilometers per second," I said without thinking.  Then I realized what I had said.  "I think that was my implant," I added.</p>

<p>"And what else does your implant know about this?"</p>

<p><em>Engram synchronization will not be immediate.</em>  I reported this thought and said, "whatever that means."</p>

<p>But after that there were no other messages on the subject, conscious or otherwise.</p>

<p>"We have to leave," I said.  "This is Seville.  Right now everyone is all boggled because the exile is broken and their toys are working again, but eventually someone is going to realize just exactly which alien species we are and we probably don't want to be here when they do."</p>

<p>"Well we can fold now.  Back to Earth?  I could stand a cocktail at the Top of the Mark right about now."</p>

<p>"We have to be careful.  That bitch tried to kill us and damn near succeeded.  I still don't understand how she <em>didn't</em> succeed but I don't want to give her a chance for a do-over.  We don't know who we can trust and every indexed world has at least one Curator among its population, and they can detect our fold activity.  In fact my understanding is that there were some Curators who stayed <em>here</em> to observe the period of exile.  They might already know we are here."</p>

<p>"Well if we have to go somewhere, and everywhere has an embedded Curator, what do we do?"</p>

<p>"Not everywhere has an embedded Curator.  I'd be pretty confident there isn't one among the staff at Terra Nova."</p>

<p>So we folded back to the <em>Nostromo</em> where we found the whole scene almost distressingly normal.  They were used to our comings and goings and our return after another Curator lesson was completely expected.  For the time being we didn't tell them otherwise, but we did try to keep a low profile and asked the people who knew we had arrived not to spread the news too widely, particularly back to Earth.</p>

<p>We had dinner and drinks with Zeke and listened politely as he discussed his progress and plans to make more gravity guns.  He had added his name to the leaderboard for a few other species, as had a few of the other hunters.  They had learned that when hunting the herbivores they needed a reloading mechanism because they were even harder to kill than the carnivores.</p>

<p>Our old friend the human-form Curator met us at the door to our cabin.  My knees went weak as I realized our secret was already out, but Emma just gestured for him to quickly come inside with us.  "How did you find out we were back?" she asked urgently.</p>

<p>"I've been getting updates from your mentor.  She reported that you folded away from the critical path world CI:1859229 yesterday, and as I naturally expected here you are."</p>

<p>"Who else knows we're back?"</p>

<p>"Well, I only learned that you're actually back this moment, so I suppose nobody."</p>

<p>"We need to keep it that way for awhile."</p>

<p>"Whatever for?"</p>

<p>"Emma, we don't know if we can trust him."</p>

<p>As the Curator looked astonished Emma shot back, "He's the only one we <em>can</em> trust.  He got us our mortality cure and our implants.  And we have to trust <em>someone</em>."</p>

<p>"Please tell me what this is about," the Curator said.</p>

<p>Emma held up her hand in the gesture that we use to indicate we want to use our implants to share a vision; it's not necessary, but it's Curator etiquette.  Probably because of the emergency protocol our implants had recorded the moments before the hab ruptured in detail, and she played him the recording.  I don't think I have ever seen him react to anything with so much emotion.</p>

<p>"We should share drink," he said sitting down heavily.  He poured for us and we downed shots of some exotic alien mixed liquor.</p>

<p>"This is a shameful day for our kind," he finally said.  "She is wrong about one thing.  I considered you friends before I arranged what I hoped you would consider gifts.  You did not need to be immortal or to have our powers to be worthy of my respect and admiration.  I took you to the Witnesses for selfish reasons.  I did not want my friends to die so soon.  And then I lobbied for you to receive implants so I could see what such amazing beings would do with the powers we come to take for granted after so much life.  When you were mortal you worked selflessly and at great personal risk to save a world that wasn't even your own, and you worked with one of us who showed you her true powers without begrudging her abilities.  She was another who worked with me to bring you into our ranks."</p>

<p>"The Raider-form Curator?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  She knew she was never in any danger because she could just fold herself away, but she was very impressed with your role in the situation.  She was very clear that she could not have saved Kattegat on her own without your help."</p>

<p>"Well someone doesn't appreciate us so much."</p>

<p>"And we will have to get to the bottom of that.  As you suggest, very carefully.  At the moment this is probably the safest place for you in the galaxy because I am the only one of my kind who will be coming here.  There is agreement on both sides of the issue that whether you fail or succeed in this project you should do so on your own."</p>

<p>He poured us another round.</p>

<p>"On that topic it's beginning to look like we'll fail," Emma said.  "We're not going to be able to selectively kill the giants fast enough to make a difference without also killing the rest of the ecosystem in different ways."</p>

<p>"But if you learn that lesson from trying, then that is an excellent thing.  It costs us nothing to let you try and it is exactly the sort of lesson that...<em>scree</em> does not think you can learn."</p>

<p>"You used a word that didn't translate," I said.</p>

<p>"And you don't want to know the translation," he said evenly.</p>

<p>"Well I guess it's lucky that she failed," I said.</p>

<p>He stared into his drink.  "Luck had nothing to do with it.  Her plan was very clever and it failed for two reasons.  One was that she wasn't aware that your mortality cure was provided by the Witnesses.  If we had given you the Cure you would have been conscious but unable to do anything useful for ten or fifteen minutes.  Your implant would not have attempted emulation until you lost consciousness and there was no other obvious avenue.  But by then you would have had very little time left, probably not enough to find the inhibitor and then a projectile to destroy it."</p>

<p>"And the other reason?"</p>

<p>"None of us is really familiar with those emergency protocols.  I would not have expected emulation to kick in to save you myself.  There is much we have forgotten about our own origins.  And of course, once you were in emulation you thought of firing a projectile at the inhibitor from outside of its zone of influence.  An obvious plan once it's been suggested, but another example of your genius as humans.  I doubt any other living Curator would have thought of it under similar circumstances."</p>

<p>"What would have happened if her scheme had worked?" I asked.  "If my implant was emulating me, would that have continued?  And what about Emma?"</p>

<p>"If your bioforms had been destroyed the threshold for attempting emulation would have been lowered again.  These are very ancient protocols which haven't been exercised in, oh, at least three or four billion years; it's <em>very</em> hard to kill one of us at our current level of skill.  Even with a low level of synchronization the emulation would look and feel a lot like your biological self; it would just be lacking in details which weren't yet synchronized."</p>

<p>"Kind of like having a stroke," Emma said.</p>

<p>"It might be similar, yes.  And like many stroke victims you might well recover if there was enough for the emulator to work with."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute.  If the emulator would be likely to bring us back, why did she even bother trying to assassinate us?"</p>

<p>"She probably didn't think enough of your engrams would have been recorded at this early stage to support emulation; as I said, we have little recent experience with this sort of thing."</p>

<p>"If the emulation is supposed to be me, why can't I remember being emulated?"</p>

<p>"Eventually you will.  Synchronizing your biological brain takes considerably longer than synchronizing the backup.  Processes and synapses have to be grown and it can't be accelerated."</p>

<p>He left, and for a couple of days we just laid low.  We kept in touch with Zeke and the research teams but tried not to do anything too public that might be recorded for posterity.  And then, my memories started to clarify.  I remembered finding the inhibitor.  I remembered navigating without my body at relativistic speeds.  I remembered aiming the ice chunk and the careful calculation that would have doomed us both if I had gotten it wrong.  And then, at two in the morning, I shook Emma awake.</p>

<p>"Whassit?"</p>

<p>"I remembered more," I said.  "Wake up.  I remember <em>everything</em>."</p>

<p>"I thought you already pretty much remembered everything."</p>

<p>"I know how the mortality cure works.  Both the Curators and the Witnesses version; they're really the same technology.  I know everything necessary to implement either version.  I know how the first nanites were made.  I know how our implants are manufactured, and I know everything necessary to make more of them.  These implants are repositories of all the Curators' knowledge, and they usually lock out what you aren't personally supposed to need.  But I think when I was being emulated, the emulation wasn't locked out -- that emergency protocol that hasn't been exercised in billions of years unlocked everything.  When the emergency protocol was created there weren't so many layers of security, and it just bypasses them all.  And now my brain is synchronized, and it's not locked out either."</p>

<p>She sat up.  "Tell me it's not April first," she said.</p>

<p>"No such luck," I said with a widening grin.  "I know the codes to call and unlock a fucking <em>amplifier belt</em>.  Let me show you."  I held up my hand.  When she made herself consciously receptive I reached in and unlocked all of her blocks too.</p>

<p>Her eyes flew open as she realized what she now knew and soon we were both grinning like ten year olds in a candy factory.</p>

<p>K brought me to the dig site and introduced me to the alien leading the excavation.  My great-aunt was an archaeologist and I had visited her dig sites as a child, so much of the work was familiar.  Unlike K's species these aliens were more like Earth mammals, snouted and furry.  But the aliens working the site had all shaved themselves bare.  Their Mark of the Curators was right above their genitals, and quite prominent when they were shaved.</p>

<p>Several of the scientists made time to visit when K told them where I was from.  "It is amazing to meet a specimen of a species so untouched by the Curators," he said with a slight bow.</p>

<p>"We aren't entirely untouched by them.  Apparently they used their usual methods to make our world habitable and encourage early life, but after changing us from herbivores to omnivores they apparently didn't do anything else."</p>

<p>"Remarkable.  Just remarkable."</p>

<p>"And what are you investigating here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we are fairly certain this is the place where the Curators gave us writing.  The site is well preserved because it was buried by a volcanic eruption <em>screee</em> ago, and we are hoping to find the Tablet.  If it still exists it will be one of about a hundred known to exist in the galaxy."</p>

<p>"The translator didn't get the time frame."</p>

<p>K consulted a tablet computer.  "Eight hundred thousand of your years," it said.</p>

<p>"Wow, our modern-form species is only about a hundred and thirty thousand years old."  The scientist looked at K, and K said something to the tablet which said something in a language that sounded like a thousand weiner dogs yapping for dinner.  "Oh, that is remarkably short.  And without help or hints!  Remarkable!"</p>

<p>"It took us almost a million years to move from writing to space travel on <em>screee</em>," K said.</p>

<p>"This translator not doing names business is getting annoying."</p>

<p>"Well translators need to be told what to call things in your language.  Apparently nobody has given our world a human name.  What would you call it?"</p>

<p>"Well you came on a voyage of discovery and discovered us, so how about Seville.  That is where the first voyage to circumnavigate the Earth started."</p>

<p>"Fitting!" said the lead archaeologist.  "Pick one for our world!"</p>

<p>"What would you consider your world special for?"</p>

<p>"Our world isn't particularly special.  We are a young race by the standards of the galaxy, though obviously not as young as you humans.  We do seem to have a high number of preserved artifacts, ironically because volcanism frequently buries them."</p>

<p>"If you don't find it too gruesome then I will call your world Pompeii. That is a human city that was buried by a volcano two thousand years ago.  Unfortunate for the humans who lived there, but we learned a great deal digging them up."</p>

<p>"You had to do archeaology to learn about people who practically lived yesterday," he said.  "Your species does move fast.  We will carry your name Pompeii with honor."</p>

<p>What I didn't know at the time was that the alien computers are all interconnected through periodic Fold transactions, and my names were distributed throughout the galaxy within a few weeks.  I also started a somewhat annoying trend of other people naming alien worlds after human cities.  But I had to call them <em>something</em> and the human habit of letting the first human visitor name a place persisted.</p>

<p>"Just what would this Tablet look like if you find it?" I asked.</p>

<p>K offered the use of his own tablet.  "Of the Tablets known to exist, about five still function," the archaeologist said.  "They were active devices which would talk to you when you touched symbols."  He showed me the screen.  The Tablet resembled a flat stone but functioned much like a tablet computer.  In video the hand of yet another species of alien was touching symbols which indeed made the thing squawk like a parrot.</p>

<p>"It's a Speak-and-Spell," I said.</p>

<p>"The translator did not like that," K and the scientist said together.</p>

<p>"An early human computer product.  Very primitive by our standards today but we used them to teach our children to write correctly."</p>

<p>"You build things like this yourselves?  Without nanites from the Curators?"</p>

<p>"Nanites?"</p>

<p>"All of our microscopic machines are made by them.  We don't actually know how the Curators originally made them, but we know how to use them and make them make more of their own kind."</p>

<p>The Sevillian foldship had been at Earth for three years and this was something we apparently had not learned about the aliens' technology.  Or if we had our leaders had not bothered to share it with the general population.</p>

<p>"Some of our futurists have speculated on the possibility of nanites, but we haven't learned to make our own.  We make computers by direct manufacturing."</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>"Sorry but I'm a doctor, not an engineer.  I understand that it somehow involves etching patterns on the surface of silicon wafers, but I really have no idea how it works."</p>

<p>After we left, K plied me with a fifth of Johnny Walker Blue, a luxury I could not afford in Earth's decidedly non-post-scarcity economy.  "We did not know you could make electronics from scratch," it said.  "Your negotiators seem to have forgotten to mention that."</p>

<p>"Did you tell them that you can't make your own without the Curators' nanites?"</p>

<p>"Of course, we take it for granted that's true of <em>everybody</em>."</p>

<p>"Well, they may have feared you would think it dangerous knowledge."</p>

<p>"Considering they were developing a fold drive, and an improperly configured fold drive can fold your world into its host star by accident, I can't imagine what they would find dangerous about..."</p>

<p>I sprayed a very expensive shot of scotch across the room.  "A fold drive can do <em>WHAT</em>?"</p>

<p>"It can destroy a world.  Isn't it obvious?  The fold drive folds spacetime so that distant points touch and matter and energy can cross over.  The two most obvious nearby peaks when you are working on a habitable world are the center of the world itself, and then of the star it orbits.  Moving a habitable world to the center of a star tends to ruin its habitability."</p>

<p>"Do our people know this?"</p>

<p>"The ones working on the drive do, now that we have told them.  My understanding is that they had already figured out the danger themselves and were exercising proper care."</p>

<p>"And this is general knowledge around the Galaxy?"</p>

<p>"Of course.  One reason we diverted to visit you was a bit of worry that you might do something unfortunate by accident.  It's a fate many races warn their young of to shock them into acting more responsibly."</p>

<p>"<em>Has it ever happened?</em>"</p>

<p>"The Curators are explicit with their warnings when they give us the fold drive, so it's very rare, but some races have turned out to be a bit careless," K said.</p>

<p>"I think I need to get back to Earth," I said a bit shakily.</p>

<p>"The foldship <em>screee</em> returns to Seville in about six Earth days.  At that point my foldship <em>screee</em> will probably already be present and should return to Earth with new researchers within an Earth lunar cycle."</p>

<p>While I was waiting to depart Seville, the news arrived that the Pompeiian archaeologists had found their Tablet of Writing.  Unfortunately, having been buried by a pyroclastic flow, it would not be one of the few that were still operational.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I needed to have a word with the people developing our human fold drive.  It was a word our new friends didn't seem to know, and one I was now very afraid to say around them: <em>weapon</em></p>

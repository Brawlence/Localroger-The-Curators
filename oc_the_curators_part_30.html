<p>While our fur grew out into a surprising pattern of yellow and black Jaguar-like stripes, the Witnesses helped us provision our ship.  We watched our human pursuers board the shuttle that would take them to a world with more regular fold service to the rest of the galaxy.</p>

<p>We asked the Witnesses to give us the mark of the Curators, since they had all the genetic codes to do that, but they absolutely refused on the principle that they were not the owners of the Mark.  We had faked it before though, so we made sure to stock some dyes that would work on our new fur.  And the Witnesses had no problem helping us with that.  </p>

<p>Witnessing aside, we were planning to spend a lot of our time camping on undeveloped worlds simply to avoid trouble.  But while they were painting our ship the feathered Curator found us.</p>

<p>"I hear you are looking for places to go to exercise your new freedom," it said.</p>

<p>"I guess we're taking suggestions," M said.</p>

<p>"I have one.  You want a low-tech world where you won't be easily tracked.  I know of one that's out of quarantine but its development has been quite vexing to us.  I am sending information to your computers."</p>

<p>I watched the transfer progress.  "That's a hell of a big file for a Curator's Index," I said.</p>

<p>"I am including a language translation matrix.  There probably won't be anyone on the planet who can speak Common, and it won't cause a problem for you to expose your own human tech capabilities."</p>

<p>"Wait, if they don't have anyone who can speak Common, how do they trade?"</p>

<p>"They don't.  That is what we find vexing."</p>

<p>At the direction of a Witness who styled himself an artist, they painted our ship white on the bottom and a mottled blue and green camouflage pattern on the sides and top that he believed would keep it from standing out in most of the foliated areas of Curated worlds.  When we told them what we wanted next there was a bemused search for an expendable glass bottle.  With its shattering and a splash of wine, the old <em>Horse Pill</em> was rechristened from whatever our pursuers had called it to <em>Plausible Deniability</em>.</p>

<p>"There are very few worlds in the galaxy where this would be thought to be anything other than a ground to ground transport," the artist said to us.  "And for the most part we don't have the human habit of naming ships or scheduling their comings and goings the way you do, so you should be able to slip in or out of most systems and just park it somewhere rural without attracting much attention."</p>

<p>When we discussed this with the Curator, it shrugged in its avian fashion.  "To approach most worlds I'd advise folding to the outer system, where their nanite-based fold drives won't have the range to detect your activity, and using the supergravity drive to close the distance.  Nobody has the kind of radars humans do that would be alerted by the fast motion of a small object.  But if you go to the place I suggested you don't need to bother with precautions.  They have no detection technology of any kind."</p>

<p>"You never gave them the fold?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we tried.  You'll find out how that went.  Oh, and another hint, and another reason we make this suggestion, you don't need to go to a lot of effort to pretend to have our Mark."</p>

<p>So a few months after we returned to the Witnesses, we left them and M dialed in the coordinates of the world the feathered Curator had suggested.</p>

<p>From high orbit the world seemed undeveloped.  But from a bit closer in we realized that there was an area about the size of Europe in its temperate latitudes that was dotted with obvious cultivated fields and towns.  There were a couple of cities that might have had ten or twenty thousand inhabitants.  There were roads but they were earthen and difficult to detect even from low orbit.  Finally we settled on what seemed to be an agricultural suburb of one of the larger cities and landed in a semi-wild area at the edge of cultivation.  We wore our self-contained human tech translator pendants loaded with the translation matrix we'd been provided and walked toward the nearest cluster of dwellings.  When we got close a female child noticed and approached us.  She had fur too, but an even brown color and she had a somewhat bearlike but much flatter snout.</p>

<p>"Are you from off world?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said.</p>

<p>"Is there a fold ship in the sky?"</p>

<p>"No, we landed our ship over there."</p>

<p>"Was it made by the tiny builders?"</p>

<p>"No, if it was made by nanites it would be the size of a mountain."</p>

<p>"My instructor says that only the tiny builders can make the fold drive."</p>

<p>"That's true for most people.  But our people figured out how to make our own fold drives."</p>

<p>"Would you tell my instructor that?  The Curators told our ancestors that was impossible."</p>

<p>When the child turned around to lead us I realized that she had no obvious Mark anywhere on her body, but she did have a very old and prominent scar in the middle of her back in one of the places where the Mark is often found.  Her instructor turned out to be working out of what uncannily resembled a one-room schoolhouse.  Inside about twenty immature aliens of various ages were studying, and she rose when we entered.</p>

<p>"Teacher, I met some aliens on the road."</p>

<p>"My, that hasn't happened in awhile.  Nobody noticed a fold ship approaching and they're very hard to hide."</p>

<p>"Ours is tiny.  We make our own fold drives without using nanites," M said.</p>

<p>"We were told this is impossible," she said.</p>

<p>"The Curators themselves made their own <em>bodies</em> into fold drives.  Our technique isn't nearly as advanced as theirs, but it's much better than what you can do with nanites."</p>

<p>"You're obviously not from here, but I don't think I can believe this unless I see your craft."</p>

<p>So much for keeping a low profile, I thought as we hiked back to the <em>Plausible</em>.  The little girl came with us.  When we reached the ship the instructor said, "This tiny thing is a starship?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Show me."</p>

<p>Inside she regarded the computer screens skeptically, although the girl was thrilled.  "We know the limits on these things," the teacher said.  "You are using the microfold for your translator and these displays, right?"</p>

<p>"No, it's all self-contained.  We are kind of hiding from our people."</p>

<p>"And why would you be needing to hide from them?"</p>

<p>"We stole their starship," M said before I had a chance to tell the truth.</p>

<p>"There's only one way I will ever believe this thing can fly in space," she said defiantly.  So I closed the hatch while M took the pilot's seat.  She took us straight up until the sky was black and the horizon very curved, then she folded us out to the planet's moon.</p>

<p>"I hope you can get them home, there's no navigational aids down there," I said.</p>

<p>"I had the computer take visual way points on the way down."</p>

<p>"All my life I have been told that while this is beautiful it is also a trap because if we accept the Gift of the nanites, we would have no real control over them and we would be giving our destiny over to the Curators.  The ancestor who made that observation is considered one of our greatest philosophers and he is widely honored among our people.  But if your people really made this ship yourselves, we must reconsider some of our teachings."</p>

<p>"Our gravity plating is made of nanites, but only because what we can make ourselves is more expensive and doesn't work any better, so we just buy it from others.  We made everything else ourselves, and most of it works better and gives us more control than what can be made with nanites.  The Curators never offered us the Gift of nanites, nor most of the other Gifts their Curated children receive.  If they had given us nanites maybe we wouldn't have gone to the trouble, but they didn't so we did."</p>

<p>"Do you have any idea why the Curators denied you?"</p>

<p>"Many of us are impulsive and violent.  They thought we would be dangerous, and for awhile we proved they might be right by overpopulating our world and killing ourselves by the millions in warfare."</p>

<p>"And how did that work out?"</p>

<p>"Many of us, including too many of our leaders, can still be violent and paranoid, but we have improved a lot.  We have expanded to colony worlds to reduce the population pressure and adopted more reasonable population growth policies.  And we have made peace with some in the galaxy by giving our technology to some races that had their own needs which the Curators weren't meeting."</p>

<p>"Instead of taking us home, could you take us to a different place?  There are people who need to hear your story and see this craft."</p>

<p>For people who seemed to be living a Bronze-age subsistence existence their knowledge of geography and science was surprisingly complete.  She easily guided us to a park in their capital city where a modest crowd gathered after watching our descent.  The streets carried regular traffic of draft animals resembling oxen pulling carts made of wood and metal fittings.</p>

<p>I realized that the female child was still with us.  "Won't someone miss her?" I asked the teacher as we walked toward a large woodframe building.</p>

<p>"I am her guardian while she is learning, and I can't think of a better place for her to be as you tell our leaders what you have already told me."</p>

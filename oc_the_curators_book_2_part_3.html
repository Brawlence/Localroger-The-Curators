<p>Tokyo was not as cold as Moscow, but it was being constantly battered by the most powerful storms ever observed, and while modern architecture could mostly stand up to those storms the infrastructure around those high-tech buildings often couldn't.  The Japanese government, which by the middle of the 21st century was mostly run by the Yakuza crime gangs just as Russia's government had been taken over fifty years before, decided to follow the Russians' lead by building a new headquarters in India, which the Yakuza had subverted and taken over in much the same way the Russians had taken over Europe and the Americas.  Like Atlanta, Jaipur was far inland, far above sea level, and temperate.  The Yakuza built themselves a sprawling open-air palace in this land that they found pleasantly mountainous, but not <em>too</em> mountainous, much like Japan itself.  And as with the Russians, it was nearly thirty years before most of the people ruled from this place learned that it was now their true capitol.</p>

<p>But the Temple of the East was not a giant security cube like the Russians' Center.  Instead it was a sprawling series of courtyards separated by narrow buildings with the occasional modest tower, none of it obviously very heavily fortified; by the time the Yakuza built the Temple, the fold drive had made conventional defenses a very obvious waste of resources.  So instead of making it impregnable, they made the Temple beautiful in a very traditional Japanese sense.</p>

<p>As we cased the facility with our microfold sense it seemed that the Yakuza had made a pretty naive assessment of the situation, surrounding their First Counsel with a battalion of armed troops.  The risk of a Huey Long type situation where his own troops accidentally killed him seemed great.</p>

<p>"People are stupid," Emma said as we shared the intel and our insights via the microfold.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure," I warned.  "Yes people get cocky but you don't take over a quarter of the world by being completely stupid.  And they know what we did in Beijing and Atlanta."</p>

<p>"People get overconfident," Emma answered in an unfortunately prophetic flourish.  "You do something that works for decades, you end up thinking it will work forever, even when you should know better."</p>

<p>Since the Temple of the East was built so heavily on the idea of public spectacle, and that was what we were trying to harness anyway, we decided to take the First Counsel from his daily morning public address which was always conducted from a dais at the center of one of the Temple's largest courtyards.  Since our hijinks in Atlanta the courtyard would be filled with armed soldiers, nearly four thousand of them, all armed with automatic weapons.  We reasoned that being Yakuza the First Counsel was less worried about being killed by his own men than by being abducted, which was actually a sensible and courageous strategy.  Most men with his power would not have exposed themselves so brazenly.</p>

<p>As he gave his address we appeared behind him and before anyone could react I executed the gun pinch, since we weren't sure our bullet-deflecting defenses could handle automatic fire from thousands of weapons all at the same time.  But to our surprise nobody fired at us and when the Counsel realized we were there, he turned and smiled.</p>

<p><em>FAILOVER</em> Emma shouted to me via the microfold.  I didn't know what this meant, but I saw that the crowd of soldiers were surging toward us, not firing their weapons but those on the leading edge brandishing hypodermic needles.</p>

<p>"Take them!  And don't let them ever wake up!" the First Counsel shouted, and I realized I was thinking much faster than normal and that Emma was executing a complex checklist as the soldiers advanced.  They crossed five or six meters before we finally blinked out, and I found myself in pitch darkness.</p>

<p><em>Don't make a sound</em> Emma warned.  <em>We haven't gone far.</em></p>

<p><em>What the actual fuck</em> I countered.</p>

<p><em>Nothing is working right.  It was a Curator failover routine that finally saved us.  Nothing I made worked.</em></p>

<p><em>Then where the fuck are we?</em></p>

<p><em>I think a weapons locker adjacent to the courtyard.</em>  As if to confirm this we heard the First Counsel scream, "THEN WHERE ARE THEY?"</p>

<p>In more muted tones, someone answered, "we have learned important science from this.  We theorized that a suitably advanced fold drive could overcome the inhibitor at close range, but nobody was sure it was actually..."</p>

<p>"JUST FIND AND KILL THEM."</p>

<p><em>A fold inhibitor?  Doesn't that shut down the whole world?</em></p>

<p><em>Actually the whole solar system.  When you stiffen the fabric of space to make folding harder, it has to have a long range to be effective no matter how you do it.</em></p>

<p><em>That has got to be pissing a lot of poeple off then.</em></p>

<p>"I DON'T CARE WHO OBJECTS, IT STAYS UP UNTIL YOU FIND THEM."</p>

<p><em>I don't think that is going to work out well for him</em> Emma said.</p>

<p><em>We folded out through an inhibitor field?</em></p>

<p><em>Not far.  Just a hundred meters or so, and we barely managed that.</em></p>

<p><em>We need to manage the situation somehow.  We can't fold out from here?</em></p>

<p><em>Maybe in small jumps.  But it will be obvious the inhibitor is a useful defense against us.</em></p>

<p><em>What can we still do?</em></p>

<p><em>Well, obviously the microfold, but that only at short range too.  No tapping the gravity of black holes or even the Sun.</em></p>

<p><em>What about the Earth?  Could we fly?</em></p>

<p>A brief pause.  <em>We can cancel Earth's gravity by redirecting its graviton field in opposition, but that just makes us weightless.</em></p>

<p><em>What about the two of us together?</em></p>

<p>Another pause.  <em>Hey, that works.  With two implants working together we can use one to cancel the Earth's gravity and the other for thrust.  And you pinched their guns, didn't you?</em></p>

<p><em>Yes indeed, and they don't seem to know it yet.</em></p>

<p>While we made plans to salvage the situation we could hear through the walls that everyone else in the entire solar system was intent on making them turn the fold inhibitor off.  <em>We need to show them that it's ineffective before someone launches a conventional missile at them</em> Emma said.</p>

<p><em>Let's roll.</em></p>

<p>We folded back to the dais, behind and on either side of the First Counsel, and each of us grabbed one of his arms.  And before anyone could react we shot straight up into the sky.  A few sharp sounds from below announced that soldiers had made the mistake of trying to fire their pinched guns.  The Counsel struggled for a few seconds until Emma reminded him that if he managed to free himself, he would simply fall to his death.</p>

<p>After that he was quietly stoic, as would-be Japanese heroes are taught to be in a seemingly hopeless situation.</p>

<p>Since actually crossing all the space between where we were and where we wanted to be was not really a practical matter, we chose a small ledge on the side of a nearby mountain to alight.  Once we were on the ground the Counsel sneered, "What is this? Can't you just take me where you intend?"</p>

<p>"Not just yet.  We need to wait until your people turn off the fold inhibitor."</p>

<p>"So my advisors were right!  The inhibitor does stop you!"</p>

<p>"It's a nuisance.  But if it stopped us, we wouldn't be here."</p>

<p>Less than a minute later a lot of silent klaxons stopped ringing in our virtual ears; our fold implants were working normally again.</p>

<p>Over a year later the First Counsel's distinctive uniform was found on the ledge by a climber who was attempting what was considered an impossible approach to the mountain.</p>

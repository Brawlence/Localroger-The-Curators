<p><em>Twelve Years Later</em></p>

<p>Andrew the human Curator felt it might never be safe for him to return to Earth, but with his promise kept to solve the Nemesis problem there was no longer any compelling <em>reason</em> for him to return to Earth.  He took up quarters on the <em>Limiting Factor</em>, where most of the neuroscientists had set up shop.  While he sometimes popped over to the other vessels on Terra Nova's moon to help the physicists, he felt they were making good progress on their own.</p>

<p>But the folks who wanted to craft the neural interface for our implants were starting from a much deeper hole of basic ignorance.  It wasn't just that humans didn't know how to make a precision brain-machine interface; the Curators themselves had long forgotten the arts they had used to develop the capability, and now that it had been mature for aeons nobody really remembered how it worked.  The machines just took care of everything.</p>

<p>This of course drove the human researchers crazy, and Andrew commiserated.</p>

<p>Fortunately he had not just a fold amplifier, but an amplifier he could reprogram thanks to the lifting of our implant restrictions.  He showed the neuroscientists that it could be fashioned into an incredibly fine and sensitive scanner, far faster and more precise than a fMRI machine and working on the same principle as the interface they hoped to eventually build.  So while the physicists struggled with bulk nanoassembly the doctors were learning deep and fascinating things about how the human brain formed thoughts, received sensations, and directed actions to be performed toward the outside world.  When our own microfold arrays became ready they would not be scanning entirely in the dark.</p>

<p>Bulk nanoassembly was vexing.  Nanites could perform quality control and boot defective nanites out of the process before they were incorporated into an assembly.  Bulk nanoassemblies had to be essentially perfect across macroscopic volumes.  Correcting errors turned out to be very difficult as they tended not to be detected until they were surrounded by enough further assembly to make testing them possible.  This was another mundane engineering art the Curators had mostly forgotten once they had it seamlessly perfected so the body of Curator knowledge encoded in our implants was of limited help.</p>

<p>The nanite team had pretty much nailed it though and were now working on obscure specialty functions.  They could dial in a pattern for a building, an entire city, food duplication or synthesis modules, and dump a bucket of nanites onto a field to let the sun power its creation.  There were several test structures on Terra Nova which had been created this way.  We had resisted the temptation to expand our holdings on the moon though for other considerations.</p>

<p>Quentin, Emma, and I had even taken a bucket of nanites on a little expeditionary trip in the <em>Implausible Alibi</em> to lay a little groundwork in an unlikely place.</p>

<p>The fold team still needed a detector array they didn't have to sense the shape they needed for a fold aperture, but with any shape well defined they had not only proven able to make a precision aperture but to seamlessly deal with air pressure variations so that it wouldn't pop or release atmosphere into space.  The microfold array and nanoassembly teams were feeling a bit of pressure.</p>

<p>This was the situation when the fold activity detectors went off, and while life seemed to continue normally on the <em>Nostromo</em> for about forty of us there were the equivalent of scramble sirens and flashing red lights.</p>

<p>We had state of the art fold detection at Terra Nova, but few of our personnel knew about it, because few of them knew exactly why we needed it.</p>

<p><em>The arrivals are on the outside ship skirt at sector E17</em> one of our lieutenants whispered to us through the microfold.  We located them and folded in to greet them.  We recognized the leader of the planetary engineering team from our visit to witness the final engineered collision.  And Andrew had played for us the scene of Nemesis' defection, so Emma and I recognized keeper of amplifiers from that meeting.  And we quickly reminded each other that we shouldn't know who he was or what had happened there, as that would blow Andrew's cover.</p>

<p>"Welcome to Terra Nova," Emma said warmly.  "Can we help you?"</p>

<p>"We hope so," the amplifier master said.  "We were unsure where it would be safe to fold in this venue."</p>

<p>"Anywhere is safe," I said.  "All of our people here know what we are and we do not hide it from them.  They will not be surprised and you will expose no secrets by simply using your abilities."</p>

<p>"A less exposed place to discuss our business then?"</p>

<p>We guided them to a conference room which just happened to be bugged to the hilt with cameras, microphones, and other sensors we had designed to be invisible to Curator technology.  "What brings you to the <em>Nostromo</em>?" I asked neutrally.</p>

<p>"Twenty-two Earth years ago one of our agents went mad and tried to kill you," the engineer said.</p>

<p>"That isn't exactly news," Emma said.  "You may have noticed we are still keeping a low profile."</p>

<p>"While I am certain that's not necessary, I can't blame you.  What she did was only possible because she misrepresented her intentions to take an amplifier belt, which gave her the power to pierce the human made fold inhibitor that was guarding CI:1729140.  Since you were trusting and following her she was then able to lure you into her trap."</p>

<p>"Yes, we remember."</p>

<p>"While we know things like this occurred in the deep past, billions of years ago, nobody alive can remember such an incident and we <em>have</em> asked around.  When we confronted her over it she burned her bioform and retreated to emulation within her implant, which should have limited her interaction with the natural world."</p>

<p>"That 'should have' is ominous," I said.</p>

<p>"She made her way to Earth and took a new host.  A human host.  An <em>adult</em> human host.  This was another outrageous break from protocol, and completely unauthorized.  We do not maintain controls on our people because frankly we don't expect our people to do this kind of crazy scat."</p>

<p>With a vanishingly swift meeting of gazes Emma and I reminded each other that we weren't supposed to know about any of this.</p>

<p>"How does this concern us?  We haven't been back to Earth ourselves since before that ... incident."</p>

<p>"Her implant made its way back to its manufactory about twelve Earth years ago.  It had been wiped, which is a normal thing when one of us commits permanent suicide.  It doesn't happen often but isn't unknown."</p>

<p>"That sounds like a good thing," Emma said.</p>

<p>"About the same time we lost another Curator.  He is the one you've known for many years but who first met you on the quarantine world where you learned directly of our existence.  We understand you have a ... relationship with him."</p>

<p>"Off and on," I said.  "His path has intersected with ours a lot at certain times.  Not so much recently though.  Did his implant come back too?"</p>

<p>"No, and that's what bothers us.  We know the rogue used an amplifier to trap you, and she returned it before we confronted her.  But between the time of your assault and the disappearance of the rogue, another amplifier went missing.  We don't even know how it disappeared but it seems like an amazing coincidence that that should have happened in the course of all this."</p>

<p>"Why don't you just tell us what you think happened," Emma said.</p>

<p>"We think your acquaintance may have used the missing amplifier to kill the rogue.  We don't know that.  But we have to take the possibility very seriously, because it would mean he has the ability to kill any of us.  You two are especially vulnerable because your implants won't convey what we would consider reliable serial immortality for some time.  But she was <em>mature</em>.  She was forty million Earth years old and had had hundreds of hosts of every type of species form.  Something that could kill <em>her</em> could kill <em>any</em> of us."</p>

<p>"It's hard for us to get broken up about the death of someone who tried to kill <em>us</em> first," I said evenly.</p>

<p>"We understand that.  Our childrens' justice can be rough by necessity.  But our entire civilization -- our <em>galactic</em> civilization -- is pinned on the fact that none of us can as a practical matter do violence to any other of us.  This is why we don't need structures like your governments and courts and prisons.  We try to make sure we only elevate those who will not make a terrible mess, but nothing is ever certain.  There was a huge debate about <em>you two</em> when your case came up.  And it is very embarrassing that we made such a mistake in the rogue's case.  But it is still not acceptable for one of us to be able to kill another, for any reason.  Everything we have breaks down if that turns out to be possible."</p>

<p>"I think we do understand," Emma said.  "That ends up being our problem too eventually."</p>

<p>"Exactly so," the keeper of amplifiers said.</p>

<p>"Tell us, do you know of any reason <em>why</em> our Curator would have gone to so much trouble to kill the rogue?"</p>

<p>The two looked at one another as if trying to exchange the obligation.  Finally the engineer said, "She took for her host a murderer and used her powers to make him immune to your human justice system."</p>

<p>"So how many humans did this...<em>rogue</em> kill?"</p>

<p>Another nervous exchange of glances.  Then the amplifier keeper said, "A lot."</p>

<p>"A lot," Emma deadpanned.</p>

<p>"As I said, it's very embarrassing," the engineer added.</p>

<p>"You're welcome to stay with us," Emma said.  "We have quarters, good food, and will show you any parts of the ship you'd like to see."  <em>Except for the ones we won't</em> we invisibly winked at one another.</p>

<p>"No, we have much business.  We had hoped you could help us with this new rogue but if you haven't seen him since his defection, then we have no cause to bother you.  We hope you will feel safe to come back and complete your studies some day."</p>

<p>"We've got lots of time to decide, don't we?"</p>

<p>"You do indeed," the engineer said.  "There is no hurry at all.  If you hear from your old acquaintance, will you let us know?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>They nodded, and folded out.</p>

<p><em>Trajectory,</em> I said via microfold to the monitor.</p>

<p><em>They went to Earth,</em> he responded instantly.  <em>No doubt, clear signal, five-nines.</em></p>

<p><em>Any other activity.</em></p>

<p>There was a pause.  <em>Quite certain, Jay.  They folded out and nothing else happened for some time before or is happening now.  Even a local fold would register on these detectors, even if we couldn't solve for its location.  We're clear.</em></p>

<p>Emma sent another message, and one of the chemists knocked on the door; he brought a fresh bottle of their white lightning hooch.  We were going to need it.</p>

<p><em>Andrew</em>, I messaged, and I detected the local fold event as he joined us.</p>

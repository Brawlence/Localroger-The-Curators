<p>When I got back to Gateway I skipped the first shuttle returning to Earth.  If I went to Earth I would be stuck there until a return sublight shuttle could take me back out of the inhibitor's field.  But while I had a few ideas about where she might have gone I had no firm evidence and there were too many possibilities.  The Plasma were themselves almost certainly holed up on one of the habitable but unindexed worlds with no Curated sapient civilization, and there were at least ten million of those in the galaxy.</p>

<p>I needed more information, so when the next shuttle arrived I boarded it and went to Earth.</p>

<p>Veronica listened with a bemused expression as I told her my story.  "I thought you <em>wanted</em> her to destroy the Plasma," she said when I was done.  "She has some impressive tools for going about that."</p>

<p>"I'm worried she might do it a little <em>too well</em>," I said.</p>

<p>"When Jay and Emma were terrorizing the leaders of Earth, sending those who defied them to random places in the galaxy to make their way back without human help, did you guys give any credit to the idea that they might be doing that <em>too well?</em>"</p>

<p>"That's a little different," I said.  "They didn't kill anybody."</p>

<p>"They were doing it to nation-states that had nuclear arsenals.  The only one that didn't was Australia.  I know you have impressive powers but did any of you have a <em>realistic</em> plan in case someone pressed the big red button?"</p>

<p>"Not really," I admitted.</p>

<p>"The Plasma were laying plans to destroy every human world with the possible exception of this one all at the same time, and if Callie hadn't destroyed their infrastructure they might have pulled it off.  Their ancestors <em>actually did</em> destroy Helen's homeworld.  How do you think that makes her feel when she looks around our worlds, particularly Earth, seeing all the ways we're obviously so similar to her Ancestor's people?"</p>

<p>"Probably not good," I admitted.</p>

<p>"She was distraught," Veronica said.  "I taught her the easy and useless things first.  How to fight humans.  How to track in the wilderness.  How to spy from a distance and how to follow a target undetected.  For someone with her powers and going after the people she is going after, those skills are useless.  But she was attentive.  She is a child but also a very mature and experienced adult sharing a mind together.  The most dangerous thing I taught her was discipline.  She did not really have the knack for it when she came to me, but she picked it up quickly."</p>

<p>"Do you have any idea what she is going to do?"</p>

<p>"She is going to find the Plasma.  She will probably do that by pretending to be an acolyte.  She spent months among the exile Curators here and I suspect she made some contacts.  We reached a point where we understood that I was here to train her, not to pry into her personal mission.  She ultimately became very comfortable interacting with the exile Curators.  I had the impression she had some kind of power over them that she did not have over me."</p>

<p>"That is so," I said.</p>

<p>"I followed her a few times.  She couldn't track me because her powers relate to other Curators.  I am fairly certain she met with the Curator who gave you the solar bomb prototype.  He lives in an exile ghetto on the outskirts of Denver."</p>

<p>"Any other contacts?"</p>

<p>"No.  That one was over four months ago, and she started doing a lot of traveling.  When she decided to leave Earth it felt like a sudden decision, because she had finally learned something critical.  But I have no idea just what."</p>

<hr />

<p>I took an aircar to Denver and found the Curator enclave.  With no implant Veronica couldn't give me pictures of what I was looking for but she had a trained spy's eye for important details, and in a couple of hours I found the flophouse where the meeting had occurred.</p>

<p>I beamed the proprietor a picture of my contact, and she pointed across the street.</p>

<p>"A human," someone snarled as I entered a dark room where at least twenty beings were smoking some kind of psychoactive drug.  "What are you going to ruin for us today?"</p>

<p>"I'm just looking for an old acquaintance," I said, and I broadcast the picture.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're <strong>that</strong> kind of human," the voice snarled a little less dramatically.  "You should let people know what you are before you piss us off."</p>

<p>"Apologies," I said.  "This bioform has been less than optimal in some places lately."</p>

<p>"We can fix that for you," another said with a low chuckle.</p>

<p>"I can always burn it myself.  It's also useful at times.  But I need to talk to this guy."</p>

<hr />

<p>"What the <em>fuck</em> are you doing here?" he said when he saw that I was the one who had knocked.</p>

<p>"Did a Promethean girl come through here a few months ago?  One who knew all about our transaction?"</p>

<p>"You're going to get me killed," he said as he let me into his apartment.  "Some of these people don't like humans very much."</p>

<p>"That's a little ingrateful considering whose planet you're all camped out on now, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh they <em>love</em> your fold inhibitor.  They just have a problem with <em>you</em>.  Something about a fold-following worm which is why they like the inhibitor so much."</p>

<p>"And considering that you came here to give us the trophy you'd scored, why would you be hanging out with people who hate us?"</p>

<p>"Our... mutual friend wanted me to arrange introductions.  It took some social maneuvering."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me who she saw?"</p>

<p>"No.  I swore to her that I'd keep that secret."</p>

<p>"Millions of people will die if I don't find her."</p>

<p>"Humans?"</p>

<p>"All races.  Many Curators.  I don't know where she will catch up to what she is seeking, but when she does there will be a holocaust."</p>

<p>"The Curators will just go into emulation and find new hosts."</p>

<p>"It won't be that simple.  She can prevent that, just as the fold following worm leaves your implant in the wrong mode to go into emulation if you get folded away from it."  </p>

<p>"She doesn't carry the worm.  I got the impression she was immune to it.  Like you."</p>

<p>"She is, but not for the same reason."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you more if you tell me more."</p>

<p>"Her implant carries the thought matrix of one of our ancient ancestors who actually helped to create all this technology when it was new.  She knows a lot of dangerous secrets that have otherwise been forgotten for aeons."</p>

<p>"Like what?"</p>

<p>"She can cure the fold-following worm.  And create much worse if she wants to."</p>

<p>"Why should I be worried about her?"</p>

<p>"Her thought matrix Ancestor remembers a long destroyed world, and the progenitors of the Plasma are the ones who destroyed it.  She is intent on revenge.  If she finds the Plasma she will do everything in her power, which is much more considerable than ours, to kill them all.  And if that happens our best hope is that she succeeds, but if she misses a few it might throw the rest of the Curators into a messy civil war.  And if <em>that</em> happens, <em>this</em> place is likely to end up in the middle of it all."</p>

<p>He tossed his head back and let out a groan.  "I might be able to get you to where she probably went," he said, "but the people I sent her to meet will never meet with you because of your human bioform."</p>

<p>"Our survival may depend on finding and stopping her," I said.</p>

<p>"Tell me something, how are you at fold-following?"</p>

<p>"Better than you probably think is possible."</p>

<p>"Give me three, no four days.  I will leave a blip on the microfold network when it's time for you to return.  You should come straight to this room from the back entrance.  Do not let anyone see you outside.  And you should leave the same way now.  You've been seen enough as it is."</p>

<p>I nodded and ducked out, folding to street level despite the inhibitor once I was out of sight.</p>

<hr />

<p>"My guess is that Helen taught him this based on what I taught her," Veronica said.  "He is arranging a floater for you to follow.  Someone who will probably be loyal to the ideals of the Plasma, but young and inexperienced.  Probably an alien born on Earth who has never seen the rest of the galaxy."</p>

<p>"What will happen to them after it's all over?"</p>

<p>"They will almost certainly die, or whatever passes for that among people with implants.  Nobody will believe that they weren't involved after you do whatever you plan to do."</p>

<p>Four days later I received my summons and returned to the empty hallway outside the room.  I knocked and was immediately ushered in.  "Did anyone see you?" he asked me urgently.</p>

<p>"No," I said.  "And I've been trained to look for it."</p>

<p>He nodded.  "Your person of interest is in the next room.  I can't think of a safe way for you to see him here, but this is what he looks like."  My contact flashed me a picture of a birdlike alien with muted brownish feathers and a vestigial beak.</p>

<p>"Got it," I said.  Thanks to the codes I'd gotten from the rover, I could also read his implant ID, which meant I could identify him uniquely from a distance, an ability normal Curators are denied for what were probably ancient notions of privacy.</p>

<p>"You need to be on the same Gateway shuttle.  He will use his implant to fold out from Gateway to... some place.  I'm not privy.  But he's got the attention of the people you are seeking, and they are recruiting so they will want to talk to him.  I don't know if this interview will happen on the actual Plasma base world you are seeking, but this is as close as I can get you."</p>

<p>"It's a big help," I said.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was not remarkable for me to be on the same shuttle as the would-be acolyte.  I didn't have to follow him closely since I had his implant signature, and I easily recognized him by sight in the boarding lounge.</p>

<p>It would look very strange for me to show up on a non-Human Curated world elsewhere in the galaxy, though.  He was clearly uncomfortable in the presence of so many humans and I made no attempt to approach him.  As long as I had some approximate idea of his physical location I could track his implant by its signature from several kilometers away.  Once we disembarked I followed him to the Curator lounge at Gateway but I went to a different room so as not to threaten his sense of privacy.</p>

<p>After a few minutes I felt him fold out, and followed.</p>

<hr />

<p>Someone had given him advice on how to shake a fold pursuer, and had I been an ordinary Curator I would not have been able to keep up with his maximum-range feints and dodges as he closed in on his real destination.  After twenty folds criscrossing the galaxy we stopped, and I realized that we were at our destination, an unindexed but habitable world nearly sixty thousand light-years from Earth.</p>

<p>He had appeared before some kind of altar or console, and as I watched he dialed in a code.  Moments later several Curators folded in to join him, and after a brief interview they all folded out to another destination on the same world.</p>

<p>I gave them a few moments, since I didn't expect any more feints, and before following I used my fold senses to case the destination so I would appear where nobody would see me.</p>

<hr />

<p>This fold led me to a fairly substantial city, and the facility where the group materialized was part of a modest complex that smelled strongly like a school.  This was where I parted ways with the floater; I was not interested in his introduction to whatever this group was.  Now that I had found them I wanted to know about the group itself.</p>

<p>Another new thing I could do with my special rover abilities was a quick census of nearby Curators, and soon I was able to estimate that the town had a population of about fifteen thousand.  Other than the human and Raider colonies this was the largest settlement I had ever heard of on an unindexed world, and like an Earth Curator ghetto it had a wild mix of residents rather than being dominated by a single native species.</p>

<p>It was certainly <em>consistent</em> with something like a Plasma headquarters, but there were no signs or other cues to let me know.  For the most part it had been built with the same modest scale Curator nanite tech as most architecture in the galaxy.  At the north end of town there was a group of larger windowless buildings that felt more industrial, and through my fold senses I could tell they had larger rooms mixed with what might be office spaces and staging areas.  But if they were manufacturing anything there were no obvious access ways for raw materials or final products.</p>

<p>Toward the center of town there was also an area of more ostentatious bioform habitat buildings that might be housing or meeting spaces for higher status individuals, including a hall similar to the governmental halls on many Curated worlds.  But once again there were no signs to reveal the function of anything.  If you were here, you were probably just supposed to know what was where.</p>

<p>And I didn't dare show myself.  This was problematic because there was also a significant population of non-Curator sentients, probably functioning as assistants and menial laborers, and while I could detect them it was considerably spottier than calling out for Curator implant pings.</p>

<p>After a couple of days I was frustrated and out of ideas.  I had the world's coordinates and it looked like a much more permanent installation that what we'd built on Terra Nova, so I was unlikely to come back and find it gone if I left.  I took a circuitous route and folded myself back to Gateway, and took the shuttle to Earth.</p>

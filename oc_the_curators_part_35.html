<p><em>Seven Years Later</em></p>

<p><em>Promethean Uplift Project +12</em></p>

<p>We had been out of supplies for the copiers for years, but the Prometheans themselves had insisted we not try returning to Earth on their behalf.  The lab that made their first transistor went on to make radios similar to the ones I'd imported; soon there were tens of thousands of them and they had an elaborate transmission schedule.  They never bothered to make high powered transmitters because they became quite good at reading their own ionosphere, and they weren't in a hurry if conditions were poor on any particular day.</p>

<p>Their methods quickly diverged from ours.  They learned to deposit thin films of pure silicon crystal on glass plates, which they then used to make large, low-resolution integrated circuits.  The large features were relatively immune to the small surface defects that wreck a fine-feature human made IC, and the method lent itself to hand registration and assembly.  M did some calculations and announced that their method could lead to fold drives too.  It wasn't as compact as human technique, but was still a lot more compact than nanite methods because they had more control of shape at relatively small scale, and they could deposit a large number of relatively thin layers with a surprisingly good yield.</p>

<p>There was a steady stream of pilgrims who arrived in steam powered buses to view the statue outside of our lab and look for a glimpse of M or me.  We tried to humor them but we were often elsewhere in the <em>Plausible Deniability</em>.  Without the copiers it was more important than ever for us to bring people to the source materials when they needed to look up something that might not have been disseminated.</p>

<p>One of the Prometheans who helped make their first transistor quit the radio lab and set up her own lab, where she assembled thousands of silicon-on-glass plates to make their first computer.  She next built a plotter, and used the first computer to design new miniaturized plate masks for the second, and to automate the build process so that finer registration and feature detail were possible.  By this time they had steam-powered electric generators and crude electric motors for their automation.  M showed them how to add mechanical and optical sensors to the process.</p>

<p>They also made more medical progress with the new lab tools making drug extraction and purification and microscopy and other testing techniques ever more practical.  Their sanitation facilities had not been a total disaster when we arrived; they had aqueducts to supply water to their larger settlements and knew better than to leave their waste where their food and water came from.  But we showed them how to build compact septic systems so even their smallest settlements could be sanitary and better techniques for dealing with the waste created by cities.  As a result their largest cities were able to safely get a bit larger.</p>

<p>We had told them that the secret of really good chemical batteries was lithium, and it had taken a few years for the prospectors to find deposits.  Their energy usage was still a small fraction of Europe's during the Industrial Revolution, but we warned them that the techniques they would need to liberate pure elements from natural deposits would be messy and toxic.  They did their best to keep the waste from their chemical processing out of the environment, but nothing is perfect; fortunately, as with their energy production, their efforts were only a tiny percentage of what humans had done in our industrial adolescence.</p>

<p>We were surprised to find out that we didn't need to teach them the periodic table.  The Curators had gotten that far before everything further turned out to involve mystery-meat nanites.  I suppose one of the advantages of nanites is that they don't tend to make the kind of mess that coarse chemical processing does.  But as we had seen firsthand, nanites were also ultimately controlled by the Curators.  Our story of the dissolving Sevillian nanite weapons was taken quite seriously even though the Prometheans didn't seem inclined to make weapons.  It was just exactly what they had feared, that they would not be in control of their own products.</p>

<p>There were far more requests for our attention than M and I could possibly field on our own, so the Prometheans set up their own filtering system to determine who would get our attention.  Twelve years after we started them on the project we got an invitation to a lab set up by a student of the computer builder.</p>

<p>When we arrived she showed us a large flat metal plate, about three square meters, entirely covered with what looked like microscope slides mounted edge-on.  "I think this is the most complex single artifact our technology has produced so far," she said without telling us exactly what it was for.</p>

<p>"This looks suspiciously like an attempt at gravity plating," M said.</p>

<p>"Well, we're not in space yet so we don't have any use for gravity plating.  But we do have a use for <em>levitation</em>."  She flipped a switch, and the whole assembly rose until it snugged the four chains that were holding it down to ground anchors.</p>

<p>Gravity and levitation plating are fold -- actually microfold -- technologies, but most of the Curators' children don't really know how they work because they only know that certain nanites make the effect.  Starting from scratch, when you know the endgame, they are actually easier and safer to make than fold drives.  We had not expected the Prometheans to reach this point for more decades.</p>

<p>"I've spent five years building this," the builder said.  "I can make it float, but I can't control it.  I don't know how to make it fly."</p>

<p>"I can definitely help you with that," M said with the biggest grin I'd seen her flash in years.</p>

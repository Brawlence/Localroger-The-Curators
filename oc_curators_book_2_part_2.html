<p>The disappearance of the Chinese Chancellor was global news, but the bizarre circumstances of his disappearance were not released.  They could not hide the fact that the person who had been running one of the Earth's four superpowers for sixty-five years was suddenly missing, but they were able to keep a lid on just how that happened, at least for the public.  We knew that the other three leaders had been told what really happened though.</p>

<p><em>So are we ready for the Russians?</em> I asked Emma.  She was in our underground lair as I was in the house eating breakfast, so I had to use the microfold intercom to talk to her.  This feature of our Curator implants allowed us not only to talk, but to share sensory data and thoughts with each other or any other Curator within its considerable interstellar range.</p>

<p>She responded by sharing our current estimated schematic of their compound in Atlanta, or more properly Marietta, Georgia.  It was a windowless reinforced concrete cube the oligarchs had originally commissioned through a multinational holding corporation which declared that it would be its global headquarters.  The oligarchs had been getting tired of freezing their asses off in Moscow and whatever they were calling Leningrad in those days, being basically mobsters they had no real loyalty to their home nation, and they all spoke passable English.  It had also dawned on everyone that rising sea levels and other effects of climate change were not going to be friendly to Washington D.C., London, or a number of other traditional capitol cities.  But Atlanta was far above sea level, well inland, temperate, and an international travel hub.</p>

<p>They dropped the fiction that this monument was not the capitol of the Russo-American Concordance at the same time they dropped the fiction that the individual "member" governments actually still meant anything.  The building continued to be known by the ambiguous name the Russians had given it when they were trying to obscure its purpose, the "Center."  Of what, who might guess?</p>

<p>The Center was an example of state of the art human engineering, powered by triple sunlight furnace generating stations buried deep within the Earth beneath it and protected by both conventional projectile and sunlight cannon defense systems on all sides.  Access was protected by both physical tokens and biometrics; three levels of confirmation were necessary and if anything didn't match you would be detained.  The details of what happened after that were not clear, but people who tried to get into the Center without authorization tended to disappear without a trace.</p>

<p>The Director's quarters were of course in the center of the cube, surrounded by guards and protected on all sides by the best surveillance equipment available.  They featured a thirty square meter safe room protected on all sides by half a meter of solid steel with a fifteen metric ton door and with connections to all the security systems inside, and ever since our jaunt to Beijing the Director was never more than ten meters from that door.  A great deal of formerly routine business was being conducted in odd ways due to these paranoid security measures.</p>

<p><em>He'll make the safe room</em> I observed.</p>

<p><em>We want him to</em> Emma replied.</p>

<p>From two thousand kilometers away the microfold sense that would allow us to safely fold to another world light-years away let us know in great detail what was happening within the Center.  We again chose to show ourselves before the evening meal, but since Atlanta isn't on the other side of the world from Terlingua this time it was late in the day for us, too.</p>

<p>They were of course ready for us, and as soon as we were noticed we were encircled by guards with their automatic weapons all pointed at us as the Director made his way to the giant safe room door.  One of the guards stepped forward and told us to get on the floor.</p>

<p>"Someone obviously didn't give you boys the memo," Emma said sweetly.</p>

<p>"The memo was to kill you if you look sideways."</p>

<p>"I suspect that memo failed to tell you how to do that," I said, and I used Jupiter's gravity to force the spokesman to his knees.  "This is a better way to address your King and Queen."</p>

<p>Of course at that the rest of the guards all opened fire, and the bullets stopped a meter or so from us, la-di-da, and you know that shit actually gets boring after awhile?  "I'd think you guys would get tired of looking like idiots," Emma said, and together we made a giant gesture -- actually either of us could have done it just by thinking, but we wanted to keep them guessing as to how our powers worked -- and the lot of them smacked hard against the far walls of the room.  I kept up that gravity field while Emma checked out the safe room door.</p>

<p>"Nicely made," she observed.  "Shame it's just made of ordinary matter, though."  Of all the sketchy things Emma has done with fold technology channeling the gravity of a black hole is about the sketchiest, but unlike most modern Curators Emma cut her teeth working out the math of how fold operations work and when she combined that understanding with the specifications for what our implants could do, she had an <em>aha!</em> moment.  The great steel door grunted, then screamed, then crinkled inward upon itself until it was nothing but a rough sphere of metal ripped from its hinges and sitting in the opening it had once fitted perfectly.  She then used a more conventional gravity source to levitate it out of the opening so she could pass.</p>

<p>Of course we could have simply folded into the interior of the room; its walls were no impediment to us.  But that would not have conveyed the sense of drama and power we meant to project.</p>

<p>When she dragged the Director out he was screaming "What are you!  What the fuck are you!" alternating with almost the exact same question in Russian.  When she forced him to his knees in front of me some of the guards tried to raise their weapons, and I executed what Emma calls the <em>automatic gun pinch</em> to squeeze the muzzles of all nearby firearms shut with the briefest pulse of black-hole supergravity, and those who made the mistake of trying to fire found their guns exploding.</p>

<p>Once everyone got that memo and it was quiet, Emma said, "We are your King and Queen."  She turned to the guards.  "When your leaders figure out who is going to take this man's place, let them know we will be back, as we still have matters to discuss."  And then Emma, the Director, and I all disappeared, but as in Beijing the Director's clothes did not disappear with him.</p>

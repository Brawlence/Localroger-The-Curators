<p><em>2060</em></p>

<p>Our handlers pretty much left us alone because it was obvious they had no real idea
what to do with the humans of Earth.  The original plan to let them kill themselves
with their precocial toys was not working out because while they did keep creating
disasters, they kept recovering and not going extinct over them.  The next big thing
was going to be the loss of all their world's ice, which would drown many of their
major cities and create a lot of dangerous new weather patterns, but none of us who
had been directly observing them believed this would
lead to the species going extinct.  There would be much suffering and destruction,
but then the survivors would rebuild better than ever.  That is what they always seemed
to eventually do.</p>

<p>But then we received word that they were planning to violate the quarantine of a new
Critical Path world.  This was an affront which could not be tolerated, and I drew
the assignment of making sure they knew this was not acceptable.  I watched their
improbably complicated craft drop from space and alight on the soil of a world that 
they didn't realize was forbidden to them, and I realized that I was seeing something
that had not been seen in aeons, and never by any other currently living
Curator.  A ship was landing from space without ground support.  This is a thing the 
nanites had been cleverly crafted to prevent, and the humans had simply gone around
that because they didn't even know it was supposed to be a limitation.</p>

<p>I let them see me fold out, and it had exactly the effect I intended -- only more so.
I watched from a distance as the pilot raved that they had to figure out how I had
done it.  And her companion the ambassador had to remind her that they had been warned
to leave by something with that very power.</p>

<p>In that moment I admired them both, and I did not yet know I would eventually become
their friend.</p>

<p><em>Present Day: Thirty Years Later</em></p>

<p>Although it remained functional there were now gaping holes in the Curator implant
which we had been taking apart to study.  We had dramatically improved the range
and user interface issues with human implants, but we were no closer to understanding
how personalities were backed up or emulated than we were when we first started out.</p>

<p>We were making implants capable of interstellar range; these were close to two
meters in diameter as we built them out of matter.  Since they didn't confer any
form of immortality and were much harder to make than the original short-range
versions, we only made those for people who really needed to do a fair amount of
interstellar travel.  The smaller version was very popular, as those made most
forms of planetary surface travel obsolete for their owners.</p>

<p>We discovered that there were issues making a large fold aperture with a machine that
was not itself embedded within the normal space-time continuum, which is why more primitive
physical fold engines could make such large aperture and long-range folds compared to 
implants.  This was also apparently
why the Curator amplifiers had to be such huge physical objects.  I was unwilling to try
destructively probing the few of those we had captured, but it appeared that
when doing very large folds the amplifiers resorted to making a much tighter connection
with normal space-time than regular implants ever did.</p>

<p>Halfway through our treaty period we had only moved about one fifth of the human
population from the Milky Way to the Pinwheel, but that is because we had only been
doing so in earnest for twenty-five years and we were still ramping up capacity.
Terminus City had a population of twelve million, Terminus itself over twenty million
total,  and while every Milky Way shuttle passed by Terminus on arrival, nearly all 
of the colonists were now staying on board to go to a DENT colony.  There were now over
a hundred and fifty of those worlds certified for human occupancy, and they tended to
be have more dramatic skies and higher standards of living than naturally viable
worlds like Terminus.</p>

<p>Since the nanites made a moon unnecessary Sofia retired from her moon-supplying gig
and gave her amplifier to an entrepeneur who was eager to try building a large scale
non-planetary habitat.  Callie retired after twenty years as a ship captain and 
returned to Terminus to try raising a family.  She asked me to provide the usual
help with that, but I had to remind her that the Curator version of the mortality
cure made that a bit of a problem.  Instead she turned to a fellow retired shipmate
who turned out to be an excellent barbecue cook as well as a competent father.</p>

<p>Veronica remained on Earth, and I saw her occasionally on my frequent visits there.
It seemed likely that she would remain there with the remnant human population after
the diaspora was otherwise completed.  She continued to serve her shadow agency whose
importance was greater than ever as we followed the course of our treaty obligation.</p>

<p>We continued to meet beneath the Thirty Meter Telescope every few years to make sure
everyone was satisfied.  Our Curator liaison reported that there was some grumbling
about the early pace of our progress, but we reminded him that there was an
exponential component to our project as we continued to get receiving worlds ready
and build ships.  We confidently expected to be fully compliant with the final 
terms at least five years before the actual conclusion of the treaty period.</p>

<p>Getting people to board those ships was turning out to be no problem at all.  The
promise of relative immortality tempted all but a very few and the threat of ending
up nearly alone on an empty world convinced the few holdouts.</p>

<p>While they hadn't made much progress on personality backup our researchers hadn't been
sitting on their hands.  Having duplicated all the Curator nanites worth duplicating
they had gone on to create new varieties, including the direct energy harvesters that
made DENT worlds possible.  They had gone on to emulate a wide variety of traditional
construction materials far better than the Curators' nanite ecosystem could, and had
even created a nanite based fold drive that was far smaller and more capable than the
Curators' version.  This was helpful because it removed the fold drive as a bottleneck
in ship manufacture, and freed up bulk nanoassembly capacity for implants.</p>

<p>Finding the Curators' version of the microfold network to be laughably inadequate for
human needs, we had also started building our own version capable of keeping planetary information networks synchronized at a pace that could hardly be imagined in the Milky Way.</p>

<p>We tried to keep some of this from being broadcast too widely back home, but I was
fairly sure the Curators were sneaking an occasional human form agent onto our
ships; it would be impossible to detect them if they didn't bring amplifiers along
and they had had plenty of time for suitably young hosts to mature into loyal adult
agents.  I paid much closer attention to the people who were <em>returning</em> to the 
Milky Way, most of whom were obviously ship's crew and researchers.  Eventually 
though as the diaspora wound up the sheer number of shuttles would make it 
impossible to keep tabs even on that population.</p>

<p>Veronica moved to Atlanta where parts of the old Russo-American Center complex had
been repurposed for her agency.  She didn't need to live near any particular place
since she had a Curator implant, but she also had the Cure and most people still on
Earth didn't, so it became awkward to live in a place where everyone had known her
for too long.  </p>

<p>"So am I really immortal yet?" she asked as we shared coffee at a sidewalk cafe in
downtown Atlanta, watching all the implantless short-timers frantically rush to 
meet the obligations that kept them alive and prosperous.</p>

<p>"It seems likely," I said.  "You've had the implant for fifty years, a lot longer
than Jay had his before his emulation kicked in to wreck the Sevillian inhibitor.
Of course we don't know for sure, since the Curators themselves seem to have 
forgotten all the fine details and we're having stupidly slow progress recreating
their original work on that front."</p>

<p>"I'd have to find a host though.  Take over a little child like a changeling."</p>

<p>"That is the way it would work.  You could just live in emulation.  I am told
it's possible to have a rich existence there."</p>

<p>"With no contact with the real universe though."</p>

<p>"That's the way that would work," I agreed.</p>

<p>"Fuck that," she said, and I nodded.</p>

<p>"You do realize what most people would think of that," she added.</p>

<p>"All too well.  I've <em>done it</em> enough times.  It isn't really cruel though.  If
I hadn't grown into a Curator, I would have died.  That's honestly my human 
host talking.  I'm very aware of whether I'm thinking as my human or Curator self."</p>

<p>"It may be a bit harder to find children who are on the brink of death to save
in a world with far fewer children and an economy of plenty."</p>

<p>"That's a thing," I admitted.</p>

<p>"So what would you do?"</p>

<p>"How many people have you killed?"</p>

<p>She blinked.  "You know that's a terribly impolite question to ask if you know
the answer is more than zero."</p>

<p>"I would take a host," I said.  "I've gotten used to being human, and it would
be a human child.  If only prosperous, healthy children were available I would
take the least fortunate one I could find and draw it toward my personality
gradually so that its guardians would be unlikely to notice.  I've done it 
that way a few times and repeating childhood is awkward and not that much fun
but once you are old enough and you have our other abilities you have the power
to pretty much do whatever you need to in any society.  That is likely to be 
true for awhile even among humans."</p>

<p>"It's probably best if we don't let them know about this."</p>

<p>"True.  But in the end they need us more than they probably realize, so I
refuse to entertain guilt about it."</p>

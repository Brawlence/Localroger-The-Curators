<p><em>For Immediate Release via Microfold Relay</em></p>

<p><em>Scope:</em> All-Galaxy</p>

<p><em>Section:</em> Breaking News</p>

<p><em>Origin:</em> Orion R18 Lee 1 Curator Index:1742660</p>

<p><em>Title:</em> An Unprecedented Ultimatum from the Curators</p>

<p><em>Byline:</em>  Associated Colonial Press</p>

<p>The mood is chaos and shock today in ruling councils across the galaxy as the humans
of Earth [CI:1742660] have released an account of an ultimatum they received 
from the Curators, delivered by a luminous booming apparition which took over their
council chamber to issue its demands.</p>

<p>The humans, whose command of fold technology is better than that of any of us other 
than the Curators themselves, have verified that this apparition was accompanied by
phenomena which could only have been produced by Curator-level technology.</p>

<p>The apparition demanded that the humans cease all further research into advanced
technology and all trade in those technologies they have developed with the rest of
the galaxy.  It claimed the capability of overwhelming the humans' fold defenses
which famously thwarted the Sevillian [CI:1729140] attempt to fold Earth into its
sun, and overtly threatened to fold the human worlds, starting with Earth itself,
into their stars if the humans do not comply.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Earth's government was kind enough to provide clarification over the
microfold.  We asked if they were certain that the Curators could overwhelm their
fold defence.</p>

<p>"We're very sure," she said.  "One of their agents used this technology which they
call an amplifier to penetrate the shield the Curators erected around Seville as 
punishment for their fold attack against Earth and Kattegat [CI:1659441].
That inhibitor was actually built by humans and worked on the same principle as
our planetary defenses."</p>

<p>While the humans decide how to react to this threat, other races across the galaxy 
have cause to wonder where they stand.  The apparition lamented that the Curators
had given humans what sounded like permission to take colony worlds, and while that
does not seem to be the crux of their complaint against the humans the Raiders of
Kattegat were among the first beneficiaries of human technology in
order to take colonies to supplement the natural resources of their metal-poor
homeworld.</p>

<p>The Hyacinth [CI:1302090] were early promoters of human technology on a galactic 
scale, forming a consortium to manufacture human style supergravity drives and
spearheading the design of surface landing fold ships which have become increasingly
common in some parts of the galaxy.</p>

<p>The Prometheans [CI:1698802] developed the glass tech multiplex fold and supergravity
drive which is more easily built by other races who lack the humans' fetish for
fine scale precision engineering.  Although it was not directed to them they have
already broadcast a response to the Curators' ultimatum.  (See article: <em>Prometheans
to Curators: May We Suggest a Coitally Novel Experience</em>)</p>

<p>But it is the natives of CI:174114, who reduced the Promethean directions to a practice
more easily followed when starting with Curator nanite technology, and those worlds which have 
since built fold drive shops based on their technique which seem to have the most to 
worry about.  If we are to take the humans' account at face value, it is the dissemination
of this technology throughout the galaxy and the great change it promises for our 
patterns of trade which most upset the Curators and drove them to take this action.</p>

<p>It may have particularly infuriated the Curators that the humans went to great effort
to make sure that every Curated world in the galaxy has a copy of those instructions.</p>

<p>Our human spokesman elaborated on the seriousness of the threat.  "It is known to us
that the rumors of an ancient Curator fold war which saw dozens of worlds folded into
their stars are actually true.  There are clearly lines of political power and dispute
among the Curators, although it is hard for us to see them and they do not seem
to form anything we would recognize as an organization or hierarchy."</p>

<p><strong>BREAKING</strong></p>

<p>In the original draft of this article we concluded by reporting that the humans had 
not yet prepared a response to the Curators.  But as we were preparing this article
for broadcast the human spokesman contacted us with an addendum.</p>

<p>"This is the statement of the unified government of Earth on the matter of the
Curator ultimatum," she said.  "We recognize that the Curators consider this galaxy
to be their garden which they manage according to their plan, and we acknowledge
that we have transgressed their plan in ways which may be both disruptive and 
irreversible.  Accordingly, we will leave the Milky Way so that they may continue
to maintain their garden acording to their plan without further interference from us."</p>

<p>Of course we requested clarification of that astonishing phrase <em>leave the Milky Way</em>.</p>

<p>"Specifically, we plan to evacuate our colony worlds and return them to the Curators.
We will not fully abandon the Earth but in recognition of its location within the
Curators' garden we will draw its population down to less than one hundred million
and close its high-tech manufacturing industries.  We will also cease trade in high
technology with other species effective immediately.  These are the terms of an
agreement we have offered and which has been accepted by a representative of those who
sent the ultimatum."</p>

<p>But to the obvious following questions -- where will they go, how will they get
fifteen billion people there, and how will they house those people in a place where
the Curators have not been making habitable worlds for billions of years, she only
said "those matters are under development."</p>

<p>It is both breathtaking and terrifying to consider what it might mean if the humans
really do manage to migrate <em>en masse</em> to another galaxy.  That would seem to be a
feat beyond the capability of even the Curators themselves, and if they pull it off
it might be the humans' own way of suggesting a coitally novel experience.</p>

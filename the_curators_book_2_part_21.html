<p>Back on Terra Nova, Zeke was putting the finishing touches on his new killing machine.  He had given up on conventional human tech and fitted his flying sled with something that looked like a giant electric bazooka.</p>

<p>"What the hell is that?" Emma asked as we sized it up.</p>

<p>"Gravity plating railgun," Zeke said as he completed an adjustment.  Sure enough, we realized the launch tube was made up of hundreds of circular plates of nanite gravity plating in a four meter long stack.</p>

<p>"Gave up on explosive propellants?" Emma said brightly.</p>

<p>"Not good enough," Zeke said.  "These fuckers are tough.  I've got first kill but I'm still going to get first one-shot on 'em.  We can't blow a hundred rounds of antique ammo on every one of half a million individual critters."</p>

<p>"That thing must weigh a ton," I said.</p>

<p>"Just about.  Gotta love gravity plating though.  Doesn't matter how much something weighs if you can get it in the field, it just floats."</p>

<p>"So what does this thing fire?"</p>

<p>Zeke tossed her a metal bar.  It was about three centimeters diameter, half a meter long, and Emma seemed surprised at its heft as she caught it.  "Tungsten," Zeke said.  "And we'll recover and recycle them."</p>

<p>"About seven kilograms, right?"</p>

<p>"Should be enough to punch through that tough skin."</p>

<p>"What's your target velocity?"</p>

<p>"About two kilometers per second.  Should look satisfyingly like a normal gunshot to the spectators.  And no recoil."</p>

<p>"Just a second," Emma said.  "How the hell do you get that kind of acceleration from gravity plating?"  She didn't say it out loud but that's on the order of what she could summon by directing the gravity of a black hole, and that's a little more intense than what holds us down to the floor.</p>

<p>"That you would have to ask the technical guys.  I'm just aiming it at the monsters."</p>

<p>At Zeke's direction we found the weapons lab and found the railgun team.  "Oh, it was quite an adventure," one of the engineers bragged.  "I was on the team that was trying to reverse engineer this stuff before the Curators paid us for the Sevillian fold inhibitor by giving us the technique.  Nanite plating contains protective circuitry to keep it from being overloaded past about two and a half Earth gravities, but we found that with the Curator's description we could locate functional elements within the nanite lattice, and we could selectively disable the overload sensors by burning them out with an ultraviolet laser.  Takes about half an hour to treat one of these plates."</p>

<p>He handed us a single railgun plate, half a centimeter thick and thirty centimeters in diameter with a three centimeter central borehole.</p>

<p>"This made it possible to push the plates to a hundred gravities, at least for a few milliseconds before they would start to melt.  And by selectively leaving some of the overloads in place we could refractively focus the beam, so the whole plate's effect is concentrated mostly along the central bore.  That got us to a thousand gravities, and stacking five hundred plates to make a four meter long cannon gives us a combined half million gravities over the length of the bore.  Takes about five milliseconds to get the projectile up to speed, and in classic fold fashion the bullet has a lot more energy than we put into the gravity pulses.  Conservation of energy, take that!"</p>

<p>"How does it compare to the Lahti?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the elephant gun manages about eight hundred meters per second for a three hundred gram projectile.  So em-vee squared makes the railgun over a hundred times more powerful."</p>

<p>"But it took three hundred Lahti rounds to take one of these things down, and it still lived for a few more hours after the attack."</p>

<p>"True, but this will hit it all at once, and put all the energy in one chosen spot.  If Zeke hits the heart or brain, it's lights out."</p>

<p>The biologists were less impressed.</p>

<p>"He'll probably get a one-shot kill with it," the research head said, "but not every time.  You would pretty much need a direct hit on the heart or the brain for a quick kill, and everything is well protected.  The big guys, both carnivores and herbivores, have thick skulls and their hearts are protected deep within the mass of their body.  And their other vulnerable points are much smaller targets, hitting one of them in one shot would be a trick shot of the first order."</p>

<p>"Any luck on your end?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not much.  The evolutionary arms race has reduced diversity so that there aren't a lot of macroscopic animal species and the ones that have survived are pretty closely related.  Pretty much all the macrofauna we've found are more closely related to each other than just the mammals of Earth are.  If you get down to individuals weighing less than a kilogram there are a few less related stragglers, but those would be likely to survive the Curators' asteroid anyway.  That's what our ancestors were in the Cretaceous."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't a natural pandemic be likely to wipe everything out?"</p>

<p>"You'd think so, but we really haven't found many sick animals, and we think all of those have been old.  It may be that these forms are the <em>survivors</em> of a wave of pandemics that left them all with similar immune complexes."</p>

<p>"There's nothing biochemically different about the big and small forms?"</p>

<p>"Not that we've found at the scale of interest.  Everything on land larger than a wolf or gazelle is pretty much the same class, and forming only a handful of orders.  If there were other megafauna classes the beakosaurs and their relatives must have wiped them out long ago.  We have yet to propose even a simulated disease organism that might affect the big guys that wouldn't affect the smaller ones even harder.  And they have similar vulnerabilities to chemical toxins as well."</p>

<p>"One of the hunters suggested that they could go for poisoning with small pellets of something highly toxic like Polonium-210 instead of going for outright kills.  After a few thousand years there'd be nothing left in the environment but harmless trace amounts of decay products.  But the problem with that is that scavengers would ingest and spread the toxin.  Any successful program is going to leave a lot of carrion lying around to be scavenged, and if we make a real dent in the large animals' population we would expect at least a temporary surge in numbers of the smaller ones as a result."</p>

<p>"So you're telling us we offered to show off our celebrated killing skill on a world of unkillable super predators."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not just the <em>predators</em>.  Don't even get me started on the <em>herbivores</em>.  They have effective defenses against the predators, and the kind of bad temper we might have if we were being hunted all day long by actual T. Rexes back home.  And <em>they</em> form herds."</p>

<p>"The ironic thing is that this is exactly the reason the Curators want to throw an asteroid at the place; in a lot of ways it's even further along a dead end evolutionary pathway than Earth was 65 million years ago.  Even if we wipe out all the biggest guys, considering who will be left it's very likely they'll just re-evolve as surviving smaller species reoccupy the niches we open."</p>

<p>"So you think we're wasting our time?"</p>

<p>"Not so far.  The boys will have their fun -- and it's kind of fun watching them bash their heads against this particular wall -- and we're learning a lot; politeness forbids us from doing this kind of survey on most of the worlds we visit.  But as for fulfilling our stated mission?  I think you're going to end up slinking back to the Curators and admitting that this time they had the right idea."</p>

<p>Of course we turned out to see Zeke go for what would be the first one-shot kill of the entire campaign.  In keeping with his goal he hadn't fitted his gravity railgun with a means to reload it.  It had been fired a few times to sight it in but it needed to be loaded from the rear.  The bullet was held in place with light duty clips until the gravity plating stack went to work.  The new flying sled was longer and wider than the one that had flown the Lahti, and like that one Zeke flew it on his belly lying alongside his gravity gun.</p>

<p>"Doesn't the gravity pulse affect <em>you</em> at such close proximity?" Emma asked when she saw the arrangement.</p>

<p>"A little.  But the plating is focused to affect things beyond its bore as little as possible.  I can feel a little jerk when it fires, but nothing dangerous."</p>

<p>While we talked Zeke loaded the gun, carefully pushing the bullet into place through the hole in the rear of the cannon.  There was a faint click as the clips locked it in place.</p>

<p>"So who cut all the gravity plating donuts?"</p>

<p>"The scientists cut the first few prototypes but when they told me what might be possible I arranged to order them custom grown.  It was a lot of fun trying to explain to the alien procurement agent why we wanted a thousand gravity plating circles this size with holes in the middle."</p>

<p>"What did you tell them?"</p>

<p>"Special form space hydroponic lab.  Humans are always doing weird shit nobody else would think of so nobody's the wiser."</p>

<p>"Some of the Curators are going to have a cow when they learn about this," Emma said after we left.</p>

<p>"They already have a whole dairy farm, don't they?"</p>

<p>We took up position on the observation flyer and watched through our binoculars as Zeke closed in on his prey.  He was intent on getting as close as possible for both maximum impact energy and best aim; he was going to try for a heart shot, and the animal's heart was deeply located behind half a meter of other flesh, including a very thick and tough layer of skin and scales.  Fortunately the flyer was silent, and Zeke was sensibly approaching from the animal's blind spot in the rear this time.  He took his time placing the laser sight dot where the anatomists had told him his chances would be best, and he fired.</p>

<p>Zeke and his cannon then zoomed straight up, not waiting for the animal's reaction as it started to wheel around.  The tungsten bullet had entered the animal's body exactly where Zeke intended, and a great jet of blood was now erupting from that wound.  But the bullet hadn't exited, and it was unclear just how much damage it might have done.  As Zeke hovered the animal jumped, but Zeke had flown too high for it to reach, and in mid-leap it appeared to lurch.  Instead of landing on its elegant spring-loaded hindquarters it collapsed in a heap, with several loud snaps suggesting broken bones.  It continued to thrash and scream for a few more minutes as blood jetted from the wound and then both the blood jet and the screaming came to a sudden simultaneous end.</p>

<p>Zeke waited a few more minutes and then posed while a drone took his picture in front of the animal's massive beak.  Later there would be more barbecue, and someone would have to figure out how to retrieve the tungsten bullet.</p>

<p>In one of the <em>Nostromo</em>'s conference rooms they had set up a leaderboard with a summary for each of the largest species.  For the largest predator Zeke now had both first and first one-shot kill.  We saw that the remaining categories were bare-hand, passive, and pack-in.  We found Zeke and asked him what was up with those.</p>

<p>"None of them likely to be claimed for these biggest guys," Zeke laughed.  "Bare-hand is just what it sounds like, no weapons.  Passive means only weapons powered by human muscles, like knives, spears, bows, atlatls, and such.  Pack-in means whatever technology you can carry without mechanical assistance for at least a kilometer to reach the kill site.  Someone could maybe technically try for that one with the Lahti, but only if you can figure out how not to get killed by a giant wounded murdersaurus before it realizes it's dead."</p>

<p>"Any ideas on getting the bullet back?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Wait until the scavengers do their thing and collect it from the bone pile."</p>

<p>While we were celebrating the silver furred Curator invited us to join her for possible placement of a Tablet of Writing, so we retired early and simply disappeared from Terra Nova to continue that branch of our studies.</p>

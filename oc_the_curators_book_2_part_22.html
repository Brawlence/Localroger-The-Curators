<p>The silver-furred Curator brought us to a world that strongly resembled Earth in its mix of megafauna, its widely separated continents and its prominent ice caps.  She was wearing an amplifier belt and when we asked if that was necessary to introduce writing, she said no, there was another ongoing project for which she happened to need it.</p>

<p>Our species of interest was confined to one subcontinental land mass by the oceans and climatic barriers.  Their ancestors going back a few million years had been small pack carnivores like wolves, but they had adopted a bipedal gait and fingers as a changing climate altered their circumstances.</p>

<p>The Curators had encouraged them to become omnivorous, introducing genetic modifications to lengthen their digestive tract and giving them fire for cooking to make tough plant fibers more digestable.  A million years of hunting and gathering had drawn them toward a fairly common body profile so that they could run, see at a distance, and pick and carry forage.  They had spears and atlatls but not the bow, and they did have flintknapping for making points but they had not elevated it to the art humans once had before other technologies came along.</p>

<p>More recently the Curators had introduced agriculture by teaching them to spread and cover seeds in places where they might want mature plants in the future.  This had allowed them to reduce their range of nomadic migration, but they still lived in small mobile clans and did not have anything like formal trade.</p>

<p>"How long have they known about seeds and planting?" I asked as we watched one of the tribes from afar.</p>

<p>"About twenty-five hundred years."</p>

<p>"It seems odd that they haven't progressed more.  On Earth cities quickly emerged after agriculture was developed."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, as in most ways Earth is an outlier.  This is a more normal pace of development, but one which we do think it's time to move along."  She showed Emma the tablet of writing which one of us would leave with them once, as with the recipients of the fire stone, we had identified the best candidate to receive it.</p>

<p>The tablet was in introduction mode, and displayed a single glyph which we recognized from the written form of Galactic Common.  When Emma touched the tablet it glowed and spoke the sound represented by the glyph.  Emma spoke a few words of Common, and they appeared on the tablet.</p>

<p>"We're teaching them Common?" she asked skeptically.</p>

<p>"No, just using the glyphs; no reason to reinvent the wheel.  The tablet actually knows their language and will actively guide them once they reach a suitable level of development."</p>

<p>"What will they write with?"</p>

<p>"At first they can write on the tablet with a finger or stick.  Eventually it will require them to use a coating like pigment or soot, and the tablet won't be permanently stained like the other surfaces they will be sure to try.  As with the fire stone the idea is to form habits which become useful tools to implement the behavior we want to encourage."</p>

<p>"That's rather like the way we train animals," I said, and Emma looked at me sharply.</p>

<p>But the Curator was nonplussed.  "That's appropriate, because we are animals," she said.  "That is not something we want to abandon.  Even our Curator implants are carefully engineered not to turn us into machines."</p>

<p>"But these methods are more manipulative than informative.  We aren't really teaching them why writing is important and useful, we're conditioning them to do it without thinking."</p>

<p>"But that's the steadiest way of introducing a new skill.  At this point in their development it is more useful to introduce useful skills than a philosophical appreciation of why they need those skills.  This species is in a much stronger position than the last one we met; it has a much larger population and they face fewer threats both individually and existentially.  Each of our gifts is meant to strengthen them further without entirely replacing their original uniqueness with our own vision."</p>

<p>Since we were observing these guys in the daytime, our camp was on the same side of the world but on the far side of a field of glaciers which they had not yet figured out how to cross.  The Curator diagrammed our decision making process in glowing glyphs in the air between us.  "Tribe eighteen has the best distribution of cultivated patches," she said, "making them more likely to use writing for record-keeping and extending their agricultural skill.  But tribe thirty has the widest association with other tribes, making them more likely to use writing for trade and negotiation.  I'm interested to hear your reasoning on which to favor."</p>

<p>"I take it part of the lesson will be basic math?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they can already count to about twenty, and part of the lesson will be to extend that."</p>

<p>"I'd go with the potential traders then," Emma said.  "Trade will put pressure on resource availability kind of forcing them in that direction too."</p>

<p>"I agree.  That's what drove it on Earth," I added.</p>

<p>The Curator made a gesture we recognized as her race's expression of a sigh.  "Of course, but that's exactly why we <em>don't</em> want to give them the tablet.  We want them to absorb change at a manageable pace.  By the time anyone realizes the farmers are doing something different, they will have mastered the art and given it a fixed place in their routine.  Further uses will follow but at a measured rate as new tribes are exposed to the art and pick it up with a focus on that purpose.  Do you see?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if that's the goal then your decision makes sense, and it is your project."</p>

<p>"You would of course take the risk of explosive growth, because that is your only experience.  These people are gradually being lifted from privation and the risk of predation and have never made war.  Humans had to develop quickly because other humans were developing quickly too and it became a race.  But it was all among yourselves, and unnecessary.  The universe is not so hostile that we need to get up to speed to make war with it."</p>

<p>"But haven't a lot of races, including our own Ancestors, been wiped out by their own stars making their system uninhabitable?  Wouldn't it make sense to resist such a conclusion?"</p>

<p>"So human.  As one of your poets once said, 'rage rage against the dying of the light.'"  But the light always dies.  This is the natural progression of things.  The background color of space is the blackness of nothing."</p>

<p>"The Curators have gone to some considerable effort to not die all that soon," I said carefully.</p>

<p>"This is true, but as our friends the Witnesses are fond of pointing out, even we aren't immortal.  We just drag it out so that we can properly manage the task of Curation.  But long life also separates us from the dynamic reality of life in our garden.  Once we are Curators, we can never again simply live among our children without being constantly aware that we are different.  We can never truly be friends with creatures that do not share our longevity, and if our longevity were universal, our garden would be ruined.  All patterns of change would be frozen or disrupted."</p>

<p>We watched for another week and then I made the gift of the tablet to the tribe which had the most extensive cultivated plots.  Although calling them "cultivated" was a bit generous; they had learned to scatter seeds and to make sure there was water, and shade and sunlight for certain crops, but they did not treat the ground in any way or attempt to bury their seeds.  They had not learned to plant and harvest tubers because they didn't realize the roots could be edible.  The Curator said this was a normal pace of development.</p>

<p>As we prepared to break camp, she said, "There is something I need to tell you.  I don't know who made the decision to give me this assignment, but I don't think it was a good idea."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I know you've been told that the decision was made not to curate your species because we felt that your tendency to make war would limit both your population and your developmental potential.  Most of the Curators you have met were either neutral toward that decision or, as with our other human-form colleague, actively disagreed with it.  Which is fair; even Curators can have disagreements.  I can see now that I was objectively wrong about the human race in several ways, although I don't necessarily think the situation is <em>better</em> than I originally imagined."</p>

<p>"What is not fair is this:  You should know that I was one of the individuals who made that decision.  Six of us were entrusted with the fate of your species, and we voted four to two to leave you to your own devices."</p>

<p>"Thanks for telling us," Emma said.  "I suppose I can understand.  I guess we're all glad that you were wrong."</p>

<p>She made a staccato snort that we recognized as a laugh.  "Oh I wasn't <em>wrong</em>," she said.  "I just wasn't <em>right enough.</em>  If I could go back and advise myself based on what I now know I'd lobby to have your ancestors genocidally exterminated.  In your short time among us you have ruined your planet, you have taken over other planets, you have <em>shown others</em> how to take over other planets, and you have introduced new modalities at a rate unseen since the time of the Ancestors themselves.  New fold drives!  New fold <em>technologies!</em>  You've gone to great effort to not just use those technologies yourselves, but also to spread them across the whole galaxy.  New <em>weapons!</em>  It wasn't enough that you made a radiation projector out of our communication technology, now you've made a projectile cannon out of <em>gravity plating!</em>  Is there anything your people <em>won't</em> turn into a weapon?"</p>

<p>Emma was giggling, which perplexed the Curator.  "You find this <em>funny?</em>"</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose it isn't.  I guess you're right about everything.  But I was just thinking that, back when we had countries and spies and soldiers and all that -- which we don't any more, of course -- that yes, one of the skills that our black op guys were taught was how to kill with a pencil.  So yes, I guess we are guilty of turning everything we touch into weapons."  And she burst out laughing.</p>

<p>The Curator looked at me.  "And this is funny to you people?"</p>

<p>"Our psychologists think that humor is sometimes an interrupted defense mechanism.  It softens the blow of realizing the unpleasant truth of a situation."</p>

<p>"Well.  In that case there is something I do need to show you.  Fold with me."  She gave us coordinates and in a spirit of conviviality we let her guide us.  We found ourselves in a human made inflatable habitat module.</p>

<p>"What's this?"</p>

<p>"This is where I sincerely apologize.  I hated the lying and I hated pretending that you are not the most dangerous vermin to infect our garden in all of living memory -- which for us is a long, long time.  And as dangerous as your species is, the even more crazy and dangerous thing which was done was giving you two our powers.  Half the terrible things humans have done to our garden have been <em>done by you two specifically</em>.  So if there was any other way to do this just know I would have taken it.  But there isn't.  Not at this point.  Goodbye, Jay and Emma of Earth."  And she folded out.</p>

<p>"That was..."</p>

<p>"Fold inhibitor," Emma said.</p>

<p>I triggered some automated checks and realized she was right.  We were stuck in the field of a fold inhibitor.  "But how?  I think we would have sensed it if the field had been shuttered."</p>

<p>"She was wearing an amplifier belt.  We didn't fold ourselves here.  <em>She folded us here.</em>  The amplifier must be able to punch through from outside the inhibition field.  Our implants can only get a hundred meters or so, and there's nothing around outside but vacuum."</p>

<p>It began to dawn on us that the hab was completely empty.  There was no equipment of any kind, no pressure suits, no communication gear, not even any atmospheric processing equipment.  There was, however, a piece of paper on the floor, which was hand printed in Galactic Common.  I read it.</p>

<p>"I wanted to leave you with privacy to say your goodbyes, but I am not a cruel being by nature.  Accordingly the end will be merciful.  Hopefully we can deal with the rest of your species in a less final fashion."</p>

<p>"That is rather ominous," Emma said.</p>

<p>After a minute or so there was a loud beep, and then a small explosion punched in the wall of the hab.  It wasn't strong enough to harm us, but it had been placed at the base of a seam which ripped open spilling the hab's atmosphere out into the night of some world's stabilizing moon.  With our last breaths Emma and I embraced, and because it was impossible to talk in the howling and thinning maelstrom Emma spoke through her implant in my head:</p>

<p><em>It has been an honor and a privilege to fly with you.</em></p>

<p>A few moments later we collapsed unconscious to the floor as the deflated roof of the hab floated down to cover us.</p>

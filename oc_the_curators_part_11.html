<p>I returned to Earth commercially, again on the converted 747 <em>Olympic</em>.  I wondered as I boarded how many of those original Boeing engineers were still around, and how it would feel for them to know that their 1960's era aircraft had been saved from the scrapheap by their usefulness as starships.</p>

<p>On the flight home -- well, it's not really a "flight," it's more a "fall" into Neptune's gravity well to adjust our velocity to match that of Earth -- I used sticky pads to organize some of the documents M and I had assembled about our still unnamed new world.  Some of those related to files on my tablet computer and I spent some time watching them.  Everything we had gone to the trouble to record -- the pond where we had had a romantic frolic, the beaches where we had run, the dramatic mesa where we had envisioned high altitude runways, and of course every living thing -- all of it was gone in a fraction of a second.  Part of me wanted to delete the files and burn the documents, but another part of me realized these were now the only records left of this world, a world as vibrant and habitable as Earth had been just a hundred thousand years ago before humans entered the critical path, that would now ever exist.</p>

<p>I did not realize I was quietly sobbing until a man in uniform pushed a drink on me.  "I know," he said.  "I trained M at Edwards.  You aren't a warrior, J.  This is an awful thing for you to have to bear."</p>

<p>I tasted the squeeze bulb.  It was good old uncut Jack D.  "Not sure how this fixes anything," I sniffled.</p>

<p>"Some things you can't fix," the General said.  "All you can do is leave them as best as you can manage.  You're a good man, a better man for this than most of my colleagues."  I finally looked across and realized that I was talking to a senior Cabinet member.  I had never met anyone within three pay grades of him despite what I had been doing with the aliens.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do with this stuff," I said, unable to think of anything else.</p>

<p>"Well, preserve it of course.  Given your brief time there it will make a rather small and obviously inadequate museum, but in my line of work we consider memory important.  When you are trained to kill things, you have to understand them to be able to kill them.  And sometimes when you come to understand a thing, you realize that killing it is not the correct solution.  And sometimes you realize the wrong thing happened, and you need to be reminded and your students taught how it happened so we can avoid doing it again."</p>

<p>I composed myself a bit and nodded.  I realized that he had used the word "students" with some deliberation.  I did not consider myself a teacher but entire worlds of people would study and judge what I was doing.  Then the Captain announced that we were about to fold Earthward and gravity would become a bit unpredictable as we fell into the thin upper atmosphere, so we should all strap in.  </p>

<p>Back on Earth I saw that of a line of six 747's lined up at jetways, four were starships.  Humans were doing amazing things.  But at what risk?</p>

<p>I soon got another shock.  The man who had comforted me on the ship had actually been sent to retrieve me.  The Sevillian fold ship had returned early, and their ambassador was demanding to meet with me -- not anyone else.</p>

<p>We only had one 747 fold shuttle, the specially modified <em>Crossbridge</em>, which could dock with the Sevillians.  We had obviously stopped using chemical rockets once we got the fold drives working reliably on converted aircraft.  <em>Crossbridge</em> was an awkward craft with a big telescoping tube sticking out of its rear to meet the docking ring, and an extra-large RCS system.  We were working on other solutions but it had been a bit of a quick hack.</p>

<p>"K," I said in astonishment as the airlock opened.</p>

<p>"I wish I could say it gives me pleasure to see you again," K said.  "But I'm afraid it is the opposite."</p>

<p>"I know, we have a situation..."</p>

<p>"I have prevailed on our council to halt our excursions to your world.  We will no longer visit Earth.  I wanted to tell you this directly."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"J, your kind have destroyed a fold ship and a <em>world</em>.  I hope you are proud of yourselves."</p>

<p>"That's not exactly fair.  We were attacked, and we didn't fold the planet off.  We've been making sure our fold drives can't do that."</p>

<p>"Yours aren't the only fold drives though.  Ours, the only ones we have ever known, cannot be locked down as you suggest.  You have attracted raiders to our part of the galaxy.  You have created new weapons.  Before you arrived the raiders were a contained threat.  Now, if they get your fold drive, they could be far more dangerous.  And that's not even to consider your foldship destroying 'sunlight cannon.'  Made from our <em>communicator</em> technology!  We do not need this excrement in our domicile."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you feel that way, but..."</p>

<p>"You have destroyed an equilibrium which has been stable for more than a billion of your years, that was in place before the Curators told your single-celled ancestors how to assemble themselves into multicellular structures.  I just wish we could go back in time and let you destroy yourselves instead of helping you."</p>

<p>"We weren't going to destroy ourselves, K.  Even the small danger of folding our dead world Mars into the Sun was past by the time you noticed us."</p>

<p>"We'll just see how that works out for you then.  From a distance."  And my old friend K, to whom I had once bared my entire body so it could confirm there was no Mark of the Curators, turned on its awkward-looking insectoid heels and stalked off.</p>

<p>For the next two days I busied myself organizing our records of the destroyed world.  I wasn't sure where the museum would be or how it would be accessed but the General had asked me to preserve them, so I preserved them.</p>

<p>Finally M returned from her debriefing with the foldship project people.  "We have to get over this," she said when she saw how upset I was.</p>

<p>"I just saw a planet destroyed," I snapped.  "How do I get over that?"</p>

<p>"It might not hurt that our guys have the fold span limiter working."</p>

<p>"So Earth is safe?"</p>

<p>"Our personal Curator even stopped by to assure me that it is an elegant solution that fortunately doesn't limit their activities.  They would have been a bit upset if we had deployed the fold inhibitor instead."</p>

<p>"Would it have inhibited their really advanced fold fields?"</p>

<p>"A fold is a fold, and if you can't make it it doesn't matter what the target aperture is.  He was very polite about it but hinted that they would have had no choice but to destroy a functioning inhibitor.  I also got the strong impression that nobody, including the Curators themselves, had ever considered trying to build a span limiter, probably because they were depending on self-interest and the lack of remote control to discourage anyone from turning a fold drive into a weapon that way.  And also possibly because making a span limiter out of nanites is either unworkable or impossible."</p>

<p>"They can fold themselves off from the surface of a planet without disturbing the air or the grass they're standing on but we made better technology than theirs?"</p>

<p>"It's different.  Just as our air breathing jet starships are different from anything else any of them have done in billions of years because none of them have ever had a good reason to build a jet engine, and you can't build one with nanites."</p>

<p>The General on the <em>Olympic</em> had left me the last half of the bottle of Jack Daniel's and I poured myself another glass.  "This is some crazy shit and I'm not sure I know how to to deal with it," I said to the wall with my back turned to her.</p>

<p>"J," she said softly, touching my shoulder.  "I was trained to kill people by pushing a button from five klicks up.  Nobody ever trained you that way.  You just wanted people to feel better about themselves by giving them clearer skin."  And she hugged me and made a sound that as half laugh and half sob.</p>

<p>"How we will ever get through this?" I asked her.</p>

<p>"Let's start by having some pancakes."</p>

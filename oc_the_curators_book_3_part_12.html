<p>Everything about it was still ultra secret so we held the summit at the summit of
the Mauna Kea volcano in a conference room beneath the Thirty Meter Telescope.
Everyone who was slated to attend was capable of folding in.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly the Curator representative took one look at me and just said "You."
I recognized him as an assistant to the ex-Keeper of Amplifiers, and guessed that he
had assumed the post.</p>

<p>"You sent us an ultimatum," I said.  "This is our response."</p>

<p>"You come here with a stolen amplifier."  He pointed at the research director.  "<em>He</em>
carries a stolen amplifier."  And at Veronica.  "And <em>she</em> bears a stolen <em>implant</em>.
Did you kill that agent too like you killed my predecessor?"</p>

<p>"I did not kill your predecessor," I said.  "I did kill the agent who tried to destroy
the Earth, and I took his implant for my colleague."</p>

<p>"We will take them back some day you know."</p>

<p>"That is doubtful.  We are here to discuss your unprovoked acts of war against our
species and our homeworlds."</p>

<p>"Unprovoked!  You have done nothing but provoke us for your entire existence!"</p>

<p>"Pot, kettle, black," I said.  "Perhaps if you had just Curated us we would not have
turned out to be so annoying."</p>

<p>The agency head spoke.  "You have tried to destroy our beachhead world in another galaxy,
which we settled to be rid of you, twice.  You have tried to destroy the Earth.  And your
rogue agent went on a killing spree among our people about which you did nothing.  It is 
clear that your ultimatum is a provocation meant to give you an excuse to try again.  We 
need to be clear that we all understand that."</p>

<p>"If you believe that, why are we even here?"</p>

<p>"Because we come with an offer you would be very stupid to refuse," I said.  "And while
you may be very stuck on your vision of how things should be in your garden, we don't
think you are stupid.  First, I hope you do realize that every time you've tried to 
destroy one of our worlds, we've taken the amplifier you used.  And that we do have 
amplifier-proof defenses.  And while our technology continues to improve, yours has 
been stagnant for aeons."</p>

<p>"Yes we've noticed.  And that is why there will be no more amplifiers released for this
purpose.  You have my word on this.  We cannot offer guarantees against acts by another
rogue agent, including misuse of an ordinary nanite-based fold drive, since we do not 
have the kind of control over our individuals that your governments try to impose on you.
But I will not release the war locks on another amplifier in this cause."</p>

<p>"That is positive," I said.  "It is possible that each of us will develop new ways to
make war.  Our purpose here is to sue for a cease-fire so that we can demonstrate our
willingness to leave your garden to you."</p>

<p>"What sort of cease-fire?"</p>

<p>"Leave us alone for one hundred Earth years.  We will not expand or trade with your
other children, but you will also not attack us for some perceived technical violation
of that promise.  In return for this we will evacuate our colonies and return them to
you at the end of the treaty period."</p>

<p>"Evacuate your colonies?  To where?"</p>

<p>We all just looked at him.</p>

<p>"That's impossible."</p>

<p>"Our species has a history of doing supposedly impossible things.  Let us worry about that,"
the research director said.</p>

<p>"You must return the stolen amplifiers and implants," the Curator said.</p>

<p>"You made war on us and lost," Veronica said.  "Our tradition is that the weapons
you left behind on the battlefield are forfeit."</p>

<p>"I hope my colleague's spirit gives you nightmares."</p>

<p>"Nope, Andrew scrubbed it nice and clean."</p>

<p>The Curator looked at me strangely.  "Only the Manufactory can do that."</p>

<p>"Does she look like she's worried about nightmares?" I asked.</p>

<p>"And we will draw the population of the Earth down to one hundred million," the
director said.  "We will not completely abandon our home world.  But we will stop
all local high tech manufacturing and trade with your other children."</p>

<p>"If we agree to this, and I make no promises, who in their right mind would live
on Earth after your treaty expires?"</p>

<p>"We're humans.  We will probably have to hold a lottery to pick those who are
allowed to stay within the quota."</p>

<p>The Curator shook his head.  "Of course.  Well I can't agree to your terms on my
own, but before we leave there is a story I must tell you.  'Andrew' you are 
aware that we have fought a fold war before.  All of our young are taught about 
it."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"You see, you humans are not the first race like yourselves to live in this galaxy.
There was another.  A very long time ago, but <em>very</em> like yourselves.  They made
war, they loved making new things, and they wouldn't stop doing either.  Some of us
admired them and followed their lead.  And they would not change their ways no
matter how insistently we asked them."</p>

<p>"So you killed them."</p>

<p>"It wasn't just that simple.  You see, this race was like you in this way because
they were like you in another way.  They were un-Curated.  Nobody Curated them
because they were our Ancestors."</p>

<p>"Their world was swallowed by its star..." I said, but he was shaking his head.</p>

<p>"They refused to abide by the order we were trying to establish, so ultimately 
we had to fold them off, along with about twenty worlds whose inhabitants had
fallen under their toxic influence.  We had to stop the disease before it 
spread through our garden and ruined everything.  We tried to make them 
understand how serious we were but they refused to listen."</p>

<p>"How many Curators know of this?"</p>

<p>"How many humans know of our meeting here today?"</p>

<p>"One hundred Earth years," the agency head said.  "We will tell our people of the
threat you pose, since we need them to willingly leave, but we will tell 
nobody the truth you just revealed about your Ancestors.  That is a matter for
your people to deal with among yourselves.  We certainly have no shortage of 
embarrassing things in <em>our</em> past."</p>

<p>"If you attack us at any time it's all off.  In such an event don't expect us to
just slink off.  It makes no sense for <em>us</em> to try folding worlds off which are
populated mostly by people who know nothing of your plans, but we can seriously
fuck with your plans for your garden now that we know what sort of things are 
important to you.  If we get through the hundred year period of the treaty then
the people who choose to stay on Earth can deal with whoever is here on your side
at that time."</p>

<p>The Curator took a deep breath.  "I told you I cannot make this decision on my
own, but of course none of us need be alone when there is the microfold.  I am
being told to accept your terms.  I am not sure I agree with this decision but
I have promised fealty to those who are instructing me."</p>

<p>"We would have a bit more confidence that this will go well if we had some idea
how your chain of command operates," the research director said.</p>

<p>"That's a problem," the Curator said with an actual smile.  "We have no formal 
chain of authority.  Among us fealty is earned and even very occasionally betrayed.<br>
We have arranged for it to be impossible" -- he looked at me and said "or at least
so we thought" -- and continued, "for us to harm one another.  We have no real 
means of enforcing control among ourselves.  What we have is trust and duty
which can never be demanded or imposed.  We are free individuals."</p>

<p>"That's a very nice model," Veronica said.  "Hope it works out for you."</p>

<p>"Maybe you will figure out how to make it work for yourselves some day," he
said.  "We agree to your terms."  And he folded out.</p>

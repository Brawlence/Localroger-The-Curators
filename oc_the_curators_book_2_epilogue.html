<p><em>Eighteen Months Later</em></p>

<p>Jay and Emma and our old friend Quentin watched with me as Sofia practised Yoga on the terrace of our home on the outskirts of Terminus City.</p>

<p>"Of all the girls on our expedition," Emma said, "I still can't believe you hooked up with the one who has an altar to the seasons and an incense library."</p>

<p>"Sofia is also a skilled biochemist who realized several of the most critical challenges of the mortality cure.  After tens of thousands years of living as if I was an alien in a human body, she is also helping me navigate the highs and lows and rapids of my human emotions."</p>

<p>"And she doesn't have killing people on her resume as a job skill," I added.</p>

<p>I chuckled.  I had always <em>felt</em> humor but <em>expressing</em> it still felt like a decision I had to consciously make rather than allowing it to emerge naturally.  Sofia was helping me with that too.</p>

<p>Sofia finished her routine and got dressed.  She likes to perform her rituals as her parents and grandparents had taught her, "skyclad."  She finds it hilarious that nakedness is also the natural state of most intelligent life forms in our old galaxy.</p>

<p>"Ready to go moon shopping?" she asked with a quick kiss to my forehead.</p>

<p>"If Quentin is," I said.</p>

<p>"This should be <em>really</em> interesting," Quentin said.  "So tell me again why you need a ship to do this?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wanted to bring Sofia along.  And even working alone doing this kind of planetary work in deep space is a lot easier with a habitable platform to work from, even if it's just a shell with no propulsion of its own."</p>

<p>The <em>Implausible Alibi</em> had been refurbished with the latest Pinwheel technology, including a fold drive that was a bit smaller than a tennis ball.  The nanoassembly team had made a few that were the size of ping-pong balls, but they had only succeeded four times out of over a hundred tries.  They had finally realized that they needed to do something non nano-scale engineers had learned long ago, and design in the opportunity for quality assurance and rework.  This made the final assemblies a bit bulkier but their yield was now a hundred percent at every scale they had attempted.  There was still much work to do to make Curator style implants, but reliable bulk nanoassembly was no longer a stumbling block.  The microfold array people were busy redesigning their prototype designs to take advantage of the new assembly techniques.</p>

<p>We piled into the <em>Alibi</em> and Quentin folded us out to the Terminus system's innermost gas giant.  "Seventeen moons," Quentin intoned, punching up a display.  "Two for the price of one if you also buy a ring."</p>

<p>"Ground rules, besides being not too big for me to move and big enough to stabilize Terminus, we don't want too much surface frozen gases because they will sublimate away at Terminus' distance from the sun."</p>

<p>"Well that pretty much excludes the ones that aren't in the inner tidal zone because at this distance from the sun they're all going to have surface temperatures cold enough to freeze air."</p>

<p>Three of the innermost moons weren't so cold because of tidal forces from the giant.  Two of them were too big for me to move.  We took note and folded out to the next most outward of the three gas planets.</p>

<p>"Same shit, different planet," Quentin said.  "The smaller inward one is really nice and hot but it's also radioactive as hell.  Reminds me of Jupiter's moon Io back home."</p>

<p>"But volcanoes!" Sofia said.  "Terminus could have a moon with <em>volcanoes!</em>"</p>

<p>"Which would gradually die out without the gas planet's tides to knead the moon to power them," I said.  Sofia jabbed me for being a party pooper but we moved on.</p>

<p>Surprisingly the outermost gas giant had a world with liquid surface water.  It would probably be more proper to think of it as water lava, but much of the surface was liquid and its atmosphere was not too different from that of any habitable world before the usual oxygenation crisis.</p>

<p>"Can you get a mass for it, Andrew?"</p>

<p>I let my implant do its thing and said "About ten to the twenty-third kilograms.  Just a little more than Earth's Moon."</p>

<p>"Can you heft it?"</p>

<p>"It'll take about ten steps from this far out, but I'm thinking this is our candidate.  Sofia?"</p>

<p>"Screw volcanoes.  Liquid water for the win.  I bet the Curators don't have any dual habitable planets."</p>

<p>"No, their method pretty much guarantees a sterile moon," I said.</p>

<p>"And the liquid water should persist," Quentin said.  "Once it's in place around Terminus it will have the solar flux instead of the gas world's tides to provide surface warmth.  The solar wind will eventually blow it all away but that will take hundreds of millions of years.  Meanwhile, the air might be a bit thin but we could probably make it breathable."</p>

<p>"Okay people.  Quentin, check me with your program.  I set up some orbital parameters around Terminus and let the ship's computer chew on them.  "That should give us a month pretty close to Earth's month but a much brighter night sky with all this high-albedo stuff on the surface.  Now that gives us two possibilities.  I need to make about a twenty-two kilometer per second velocity adjustment before folding it into its final orbit.  Supergravity doesn't work at this scale because planets aren't solid and little tidal variances in the projected graviton field will badly disrupt them.  So we're going to have to fold it in place to fall toward something bigger to adjust its velocity.  We can do it here, which will only affect this giant's lunar system and will take four days, or we can fold it down to the much bigger innermost giant and do it in two days, but that will tidally cock up that world's lunar system too."</p>

<p>"Do it here," Sofia said instantly.  "We need this world, but we don't need to do any more damage than necessary to the rest of the solar system."</p>

<p>I looked at Quentin and he shrugged.  "Sounds like a good plan to me.  I'm not in a big hurry to be anywhere else."</p>

<p>"Okay then.  Sofia, this is going to take me out of my human side for awhile.  I have to concentrate.  If this isn't done right..."</p>

<p>"Of course I understand," she said.  "Before you start we should conduct the great rite to consecrate our effort."</p>

<p>Well being in touch with my human side the suggestion to <em>have ritual sex first</em> was not one I was going to turn down, and Quentin was a good sport and pretended he couldn't hear us on the upper deck while he did whatever humans do while their friends are having sex in the next room.  I will really have to look that up sometime.</p>

<p>And then began nearly a week of pretty constant mental-implant activity for me.  I was able to arrange a data output so they could see on the ship's monitor what my implant and its amplifier were up to.  Since the temperature of the worldlet was reasonable we were actually able to land the <em>Alibi</em> on its surface, which helped maximize my range and accuracy.  But when you are moving worlds you check and recheck everything, constantly, without rest.  There is no margin for error.  Particularly on those last few folds as we approached Terminus, an inhabitable and inhabited world which could meet awesome disaster if I did anything wrong.</p>

<p>I did nothing wrong though, and within a few days Terminus was a habitable world with a stabilizing moon.  And having gone back to my roots as a Curator for that time, I let Sofia guide me back into human habits while the residents of Terminus weighed in on the new development.  Since Terminus had never had tides before there was a great deal of interest in how its oceans would react to the new sloshing forces.  There were minor quakes and tidal tsunamis, and fortunately we had anticipated all that and nobody was harmed.</p>

<p>Of course Jay and Emma hung a medal around my neck and everyone was ready to slap me on the back and order me a drink, but it was Sofia who reminded me of something I hadn't really connected.  I wasn't just the only person at the Pinwheel with an amplifier able to move a moon; I was also the only being in the <em>entire universe</em> with an amplifier I could <em>reprogram</em> to do something like helping the neurologists out.  And that meant that I was more than either a human who was a Curator or a Curator who was human.</p>

<p>I was something else entirely.  But just what I might be I wasn't yet sure.</p>

<p><em>This concludes The Curators Book 2.</em></p>

<p><em>I am gathering together ideas for Book 3.  Suggestions are welcome by comment, PM, or email at <a href="mailto:localroger@yahoo.com">localroger@yahoo.com</a> .  As this Epilogue suggests, Book 3 will be told from human Curator Andrew's point of view since Jay and Emma are about to embark on a lot of relatively boring King and Queen of the Galaxy stuff.  We have not seen the last of Earth or the other human worlds at the Milky Way, or of the Curators, or of some of the other characters we've met along the way.  I expect to begin publishing Book 3 at the latest by the Fall of 2019, and more likely by mid-summer; subscribe or periodically check <a href="/u/localroger">u/localroger</a> if you want to be sure of catching it.</em></p>

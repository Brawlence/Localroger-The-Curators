<p>On the alien ship our Curator showed us how to claim quarters.  First we needed a key, which we had to have made.  Aliens didn't like using direct biometrics for every access request, but they did verify that nobody with my geneprint had already claimed a key aboard the ship.  Then with the key we could claim a cabin, occupancy two, metabolism type 23.  We did all this through a touchscreen terminal with what humans would consider intolerable user interface latency.</p>

<p>In the end we got entry to a forty cubic meter stateroom whose amenities, along with the nearby services, would be mostly compatible with our biological functions.  We were scheduled to fold out in eight hours.</p>

<p>We were no longer in the world of quaintly named worlds and ships.  We had fortunately taught ourselves the trading language the aliens call Common so it was possible for us to pass.  There were four spoken versions of Common meant to accommodate different vocal capabilities, and the idea was that you learned to understand all four but spoke the one best suited to your species.  Like the human trading language Swahili Common wasn't a language meant for epic poetry, but it allowed vastly different individuals to communicate when translation services weren't available.  And away from Earth, translation services were reserved for official use and special occasions, because they involved microfold communication to a world with enough computational resources to perform them.</p>

<p>And everything was done numerically, starting by reference to worlds on the Curator's Index.  We were on our way to world CI:827490, about forty light-years from Earth.  Our ship was the thirty-ninth built and operated by the natives of world CI:627960, so it was ship 627960:39.  Humans had built so many tiny ships that the nomenclature had broken down in our case, but we were leaving the part of the galaxy where that would be important for awhile.</p>

<p>"You need to conceal yourselves," the Curator said.  "Your human habits will betray you, and I think they can track our personal folds now well enough to eventually figure out where I took you.  They will then know where you are going on this leg of your journey."</p>

<p>This filled me with panic, but M just said "Let me make a list of some supplies we will need."</p>

<p>We hid in the stateroom while the Curator folded down to the Earth and then, about an hour later, reappeared.  "This is everything you asked for, plus two tablet computers and common-compatible power bricks.  I have prepped them with the entire Curator Index and a full table of regularly scheduled transports.  This should give you everything you need to find your way to the Witnesses.  Be careful not to reveal these machines' true capabilities, as that will reveal your origin."</p>

<p>The Curator showed us several other useful things, such as how to get the ship informational displays to show all the fold ships present in our system.  "If they come after you they will not be able to conceal it," he said.  "Although it will be a bit tricky for you to evade them using regularly scheduled transports.  I will alert our agents that you are coming, in case they can help."</p>

<p>"I never quite saw this being how I would start my ninth decade," I said after he left.</p>

<p>"I don't think either of us ever saw either of us seeing a ninth decade," M said.  "The world was in big trouble, and people our age tended to die of cancer or end up in nursing homes instead of being indistinguishable from children in their twenties.  I'm not going to complain."</p>

<p>"It's our own people we are running from.  They have the best technology."</p>

<p>"This is true.  But I am a warrior, you are a diplomat, and we are both human too."</p>

<p>"So what's the plan?"</p>

<p>She dumped out the bag the Curator had brought us.  It was filled with body paint and a hair trimmer kit.  "What do offworlders know about humans?  We wear clothes and we have hair on our heads and no Mark of the Curators.  So we will invert all those things."  She opened up the haircut kit and handed me the electric trimmer.  "You'll have to do me," she said.</p>

<p>"You want me to cut off your hair?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm going to follow up by cutting off all of yours.  Even..."  She glanced significantly at my crotch.  "We are going to play much hairier beings than we really are that ritually shaved ourselves, thus explaining our current total nakedness.  And then painted up of course, thanks to the raiders for teaching us that art."</p>

<p>The last part of the disguise was, of course, the Mark, which she put at the small of our backs.  "It's not very convincing, so our story will be that it's in differently colored hair when we're not shaved," M advised.</p>

<p>"Usually when the Mark is in fur color, there are also skin differences."</p>

<p>"Yes, but the body paint would hide those, and I think most observers will casually assume that we traced them."</p>

<p>When we were properly made up we left the room to find typical alien travel bags, which were of course free for the taking at a convenient dispensary.  We found a disposal and got rid of our Earth clothes.  We kept a few Earth ID items and the tablets in our kits, which we wore over the shoulder in a fashion that had been common throughout the galaxy since long before our own ancestors learned to use fire.</p>

<p>After the ship folded we waited a couple of hours and then checked the system status display.  It showed a human foldship had entered the system mere minutes after our ship had.</p>

<p>When we got back to the cabin, it was occupied.  Our visitor was tall and covered in thick, dark fur.  Her Mark of the Curators was bleached white on her chest, where a human female's breasts would be.</p>

<p>"Let me guess, you walk among these folks," I said as we entered.</p>

<p>"Good guess," she said in perfect English.  "My colleague said you were in trouble.  Easy to see how."</p>

<p>"And you saw right through our disguises," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's just us," she said brightly.  "I can see your genomic structure as clearly as you can see skin color.  You're definitely human.  But most of our children will look right past you unless they have been studying Earth pornography."</p>

<p>"Right now we have what you call a shell game to play.  There are three regular trade foldships including this one in orbit here.  They are all traditional form so none of them can land, and all depend on orbital transports.  And then there are your people, who can land, but can't dock with the other two ships.  Since it visits Earth regularly they can dock with this one.  Which means..."  She offered her hands.</p>

<p>"Are we safe now?" M asked after we got a cabin on the new foldship.</p>

<p>"Not really.  They have several days and while our information systems don't record the wealth of data yours do, if they are thorough -- and our experience is that humans can be remarkably thorough -- they will interview enough passengers to learn of the odd couple that fits no known pattern.  I'm not sure if their single ship could detect or track my fold activity.  So they will know you are on one of these three ships, and if necessary they can deploy teams to follow all three to their destinations."</p>

<p>"This is hopeless," I said thudding my head against the wall behind me.</p>

<p>"If it was hopeless I wouldn't be here," the Curator said.  "We didn't populate the galaxy by doing hopeless."</p>

<p>"What do we do then?"</p>

<p>"Keep doing what you are doing.  I am contacting our agents on the world where this ship is going.  You will not be alone."</p>

<p>But then she disappeared.  "I hope that means she knows they can't track her," I said.</p>

<p>"Let's adjust our disguises," M said more helpfully.</p>

<p>After we folded there were soon two human foldships in the new system.  I consulted the tablet and found we'd also gone ten light years in the wrong direction to get where we wanted to be.  This being pursued thing would not do.</p>

<p>Our new Curator liaison was feathered, very much like the Hyacinth but with a more mammalian toothy mouth and dark grey feathers.  It spoke in the Common dialect we call clacky.  "Your pursuers are dangerously close," it said seriously.</p>

<p>"Obvious," M replied in the more human friendly soft dialect.</p>

<p>"This has to conclude.  Fortunately our leaders have finally concurred.  Please."  It offered us its wing foreclaws, and when we took them we were treated to a dizzying flash of world after world as we folded over and over again, finally settling in the familiar palace courtyard of the Witnesses.</p>

<p>Before we could voice the question, our host opened its tunic to reveal an amplifier belt.  "Your home Curator convinced our leaders that we had created your trouble, and so we had an obligation," it said.  "Nothing in the galaxy could follow us now.  And we are told that your people do not know of this place."</p>

<p>"We are mostly sure of that," M said.</p>

<p>"I have alerted your hosts, and they are waiting for you," it said.</p>

<p>What we did not know at that time was that our superiors were doing a fine computer analysis of the fold logs from the <em>Horse Pill</em>.  It hadn't been tracked to the Witnesses by any known entity, but it had kept its own tracking log of what it had done.</p>

<p>Following those forty year old logs across thousands of light-years was a nontrivial task, but they had put some of the best engineers on Earth on the job of tracing our steps.  And so the people chasing us did in due course figure out the Curator's Index of the Witnesses' world.</p>

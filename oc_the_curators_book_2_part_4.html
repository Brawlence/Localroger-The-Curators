<p>"It makes me nervous," Emma said as we monitored the Australian Prime Minister.  "Dismissing your guards and going to a place where you are alone for most of the day is not exactly normal security practice."</p>

<p>"He knows what we did to the others, and they all had far better security resources than the Australians can bring to bear.  This is more my department.  Resisting us has not worked, so he is extending an invitation."</p>

<p>"Mr. Prime Minister," I said politely from behind him.  He stopped moving, nodded slightly, then slowly turned to face us.  He was not as old as the other rulers, and he actually smiled.</p>

<p>"You have won me a small bet if I remain here to collect it," he said with a little chuckle.  "My son in law was convinced our small continent would be beneath your notice and not worthy of your attention."</p>

<p>"We care about the whole Earth," Emma said.</p>

<p>"An admirable quality," the PM said.  "So am I to disappear this evening too, naked to whatever place you have arranged for me?"</p>

<p>"We hadn't been planning on that for you," I said, and Emma let me do my diplomacy thing.  "We do need to discuss a few things.  Your continent practices democracy, which is refreshing, but it is rather odd that nobody who is not a member of your few ruling families -- one might even call them oligarchs -- can ever manage to get on the ballot."</p>

<p>Instead of protesting, he nodded.  He walked to a cabinet and pulled out a liquor bottle and three glasses.  "I won't try to defend that," he said as he put the glasses down and proceeded to pour.  "We have some excellent Scotch distilleries here in Australia now, can I interest you?"</p>

<p>We accepted the drinks and we all sat down.</p>

<p>"Our parents made the decision to lock out our elections because they had seen what happened in America and India.  If we agree to open it up, how can you guarantee the same fate will not befall us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's easy," Emma said as she sipped the Scotch, which was very fine.  "We are going to destroy them all.  The only question is whether we will destroy you too."</p>

<p>"We'd prefer not to," I continued.  "We would really rather have someone who knows what they are doing pick up the pieces after we do what we have to."</p>

<p>"You are only two people," the PM said.  "Yes, you have great powers, but how can you use them to destroy an entire world?"</p>

<p>"We aren't going to destroy the world," Emma said sharply.  "This is our home.  We are here to <em>save</em> it.  We are going to destroy a few hundred people who have scammed and looted the place and made themselves into little tin gods."</p>

<p>"Little tin gods who let seven billion people die instead of saving them," I added.</p>

<p>"We did everything we could about that but we are a modestly sized and isolated desert country.  We doubled our population through refugee immigration and pushed our productive capacities as far as we dared to accept as many as we could."</p>

<p>"We don't blame you for the situation.  But the new deserts of this world are littered with human skeletons because the rich did not care what happened to the poor.  You could have saved them all.  You acquired a <em>Laputa</em> class ship each year, but you were making two to three fold drives per month.  The galaxy is full of civilizations that could have supplied you with hulls but you were more interested in acquiring personal toys than in using the proceeds of your fold trade to save other humans."</p>

<p>The PM nodded and tears rolled down his face.  These were hard memories for him.  "What you say is true of most of us.  But please don't say it is true of us in Australia.  We have never had the means to produce our own fold drives.  The only reason the other three powers haven't overrun us is that if any one of them tried, the others would consider it a hostile grab against their interests.  We petitioned them to do exactly what you suggest, but we have little power on this world."</p>

<p>"Our intent here is to change that," Emma said.</p>

<p>"My God, you're serious, aren't you?"</p>

<p>We just looked at him.  "Maybe not <em>you</em>, but <em>they</em> let seven billion people die," I said.</p>

<p>There was a look of realization in his eyes, and then he closed them.  With his eyes closed, he said, "You cannot let them suspect that it is your intention to make us their rulers.  If they get that idea they will destroy us.  They all still have nuclear weapons and conventional delivery systems, as well as things like Sunlight Cannons in orbit.  At this moment they have to think we are just as threatened as they are or we are doomed."</p>

<p>"What do you suggest?"</p>

<p>"At this point, you must do to me whatever it is you did with the other leaders.  They must not be allowed to think Australia is getting any kind of special treatment."</p>

<p>"As far as you know, we might have killed them."</p>

<p>"No."  He sipped his Scotch.  "I don't think you killed them.  If you had you would have left the bodies so everyone would know.  No, you did something... probably something unpleasant, since you obviously hate their guts for good reason.  But I am a ruler of one of the four powers for these last thirty-five years myself, and whatever they deserve at your hands I will admit I must deserve too."</p>

<p>"We need a ruler like you on this world when we've finished shattering the clusterfuck that has entrenched itself here," Emma said.</p>

<p>"We can always get him back.  We do have Quentin and the <em>Implausible Alibi</em> if we need them," I reminded her.</p>

<p>Emma extended her hands, and the PM regarded them with something like horror.  "This is how you do it, isn't it?  They say you have to touch."</p>

<p>"It makes it easier," she said.  "But you shouldn't be afraid.  The others were afraid because they were ignorant cowards.  We understand that you know galactic Common."</p>

<p>"Many long years ago," he admitted, but to his credit he let Emma take his fisted hands in her grasp.</p>

<p>A moment later we were all in a different, rather spartan room.  "The gravity is different," the PM said.  "We're off-world, but where?"</p>

<p>Emma and I just waited, and a few moments later she said "This is the fold ship CI:920156:14.  It was at Earth to trade a few tons of refined tantalum for a fold drive, and because Earth isn't a regular part of its route it won't be going back.  And it just folded out on the first leg of its journey home.  Our personal implants can fold you to a nearby place like Earth orbit, but now that we are 180 light-years from Sol we can fold ourselves home but we can't take you with us."</p>

<p>"But there are many fold ship routes within the galaxy," I added, "and with a little patience and attentiveness you can get home again.  If you want to."</p>

<p>He was naked now, but he didn't seem to care about that.  "You've sent me on <em>walkabout</em>?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I suppose that's a way of looking at it," Emma said with a wry smile.</p>

<p>"All right, I can imagine the others' reaction to this.  But thank you.  This isn't a punishment, this is a thing I've always dreamed of doing.  And they don't just let you go walkabout when you're the Prime Minister, even if you really want to do it."</p>

<p>"We left your clothes behind because they really are more of a liability than a protection here," I said.  "You'll soon realize that most of the Curators' children find it deeply weird and suspicious that humans are so insistent on hiding our bodies.  You'll also realize that you are in no danger because you are naked, and that nobody cares that any particular part of your body is visible.  This is the norm everywhere in the galaxy except for Earth and her colonies.  Hopefully this will give you a new perspective if you make your way back home."</p>

<p>"I understand.  I was taught all of this, of course, but living it is going to be a little hard to get used to.  What about not having the Mark of the Curators?"  </p>

<p>"As with humans, most aliens aren't very attentive about things that aren't there.  Only someone who studies the Curators professionally would be curious enough to wonder about it."</p>

<p>He looked across the room.  "Okay.  The green button opens the door, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>We nodded and folded home.  He was going to be okay.</p>

<p><em>18th Century CE</em></p>

<p>The ocean-going caravel sailing ship made it possible for the Europeans to do what
the Romans had only been able to dream of, mapping and nearly conquering the entire
world.  Diseases and vermin made their way to every corner of the Earth.  And casual
cruelty was the order of the day, as human enterprise continued to need those inputs
which were not being provided by a nanite infrastructure.</p>

<p>The European monarchs thought they were the masters of their universe.  But then the
Americans asserted their independence.  And in their wake other colonies realized they
had resources which could be used against their distant oppressors instead of to 
benefit them.  The dissolution of those empires took time but it was inevitable once
it began.</p>

<p>Then the Americans had a civil war, fundamentally based on the last gasp of slavery as
a human institution.  Human civilizations still needed the labor but were now favoring
economic bondage rather than outright chains as being a less ugly, and ultimately more
practical, method of controlling people.  The Civil War featured an explosion of
new technology developed toward the end of making more effective war, and at its end 
more than half a million Americans lay dead on the killing fields.  I wore both blue 
and grey uniforms in order to study that war and I had to fold myself out of danger 
more than a dozen times.  I thought that was a lot at the time.</p>

<p>The Civil War seemed like an awful thing, and other than the act of folding a world 
into its star it was objectively one of the most awful things anyone could remember 
happening in the entire history of the galaxy.</p>

<p>But humans are really very good at whatever they decide to do, and they were just 
getting started.</p>

<p><em>Present Day: Eight Years Later</em></p>

<p>Veronica's implant woke her up with an urgent alarm.  She quickly consulted with
the other two implanted agents who had also been awakened as she got dressed.
Less than a minute later she was in Australia where it was two in the afternoon.
The pre-arranged fold coordinates had taken her to the walkway in front of a
cast paper geodesic dome.</p>

<p>The agent walked up to the door and knocked out the prearranged pattern.  The moment
she finished the door was opened by a young woman wearing a towel around her torso
and nothing else.</p>

<p>"Though violent energy must sometimes be spent..." the agent said.</p>

<p>"It's still the last refuge of the incompetent," the young woman replied.
"I'm Callie.  Come in, I have to throw something on."</p>

<p>"I'm nobody," Veronica said.</p>

<p>"And nobody needs a ride," Callie said as she threw on a T-shirt.</p>

<p>"That's right."</p>

<p>Callie followed the T-shirt with a pair of loose short pants and then made her
way to a work area.  The dome house was all one room and about half of it 
was dominated by a work and play area with tools and musical instruments.  Some
of the musical instruments were obviously handmade.  She made her way to a wall
of drawers that mostly contained tools and parts and opened one that was primly
labeled <em>SEX TOYS</em>.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure what the priorities are here," Veronica said as Callie swept away
several vibrators and a pair of handcuffs to retrieve a hinged wooden box.
The box opened to reveal two small spheres.</p>

<p>"Are those Ben-Wa balls?" Veronica asked.</p>

<p>"Yep.  This one is hollow with some mercury rolling around inside.  Very interesting sensation that."  She put it back in the box.  "And this one is a fold drive."</p>

<p>"A fold drive," Veronica said, but Callie was already headed for the door.</p>

<p>"My mission was to have a fold ship ready that absolutely nobody knows is here,"
Callie said.  "It's important that nobody follows us and we're not sure how
good they are.  Our departure is supposed to be a complete surprise."</p>

<p>"That's a golf ball," the agent said as she followed Callie out the door.
"And where's your ship?"</p>

<p>As if to answer Callie made her way toward an obsolete suction truck that was
parked about fifty feet from the house.</p>

<p>"A <em>shit-sucking truck?</em>"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, it's never been used for its original design purpose.  And
I needed something that can hold the air in for a day or so."</p>

<p>"You made a <em>spaceship</em> out of a <em>suction truck?</em>"</p>

<p>"Nobody could know.  You can't exactly order spaceship hulls from McMaster
Carr."  She climbed a short ladder and released the rear cleanout hatch.</p>

<p>"I can't fucking believe this."</p>

<p>Callie stopped halfway up the ladder and descended back to the ground.
"Funny, Andrew told me you were the best of the best," she said.  "That
you were the most capable human he had ever met.  And that you were loyal
to a fault.  That you knew the mission.  And that the only reason you
would ever come here was that someone tried to destroy the Earth."</p>

<p>Veronica nodded.</p>

<p>"The <em>Palomino</em> isn't here.  The microfold can't reach another galaxy.
There's no way to tell them except to <em>go</em>.  That's why I'm here.
Is the attack ongoing?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then we have to <em>go</em>.  Callie scampered into the truck's tank and
Veronica followed.</p>

<p>The interior of the tank was brightly lit and its inner surface was
criscrossed with wires and plumbing.  Callie carefully inserted the
fold drive sphere into its receptacle and clamped the cover over it.
Displays lit up.</p>

<p>"We have to close the hatch.  It's all automated from here."</p>

<p>A minute later Callie entered the initiation code, and the truck levitated
itself from the roadway about twenty meters and then folded a hundred and
thirty thousand light-years away.</p>

<hr />

<p>Sensitive cameras showed their forward and rearward progress.  The single
first fold took <em>Petunia</em> completely out of the plane of the Milky Way.
The tank was about four meters long and two and a half in diameter.</p>

<p>"How long will this take?" Veronica asked.</p>

<p>"About a day.  It takes the <em>Palomino</em> longer, but we have a smaller aperture
and greater range per fold."</p>

<p>"Why does it take any time at all if folding is instantaneous?"</p>

<p>"When we fold, we exert a force on the fabric of space-time.  It's a small
force but it's larger for a long distance jump or a large aperture.  After
the fold is released space-time rebounds, and for awhile afterward another
fold from that location will be unreliable.  We need to let the space-time
continuum stabilize so our navigation will be good to make the next fold.
And it will take us about seven hundred folds to reach the Pinwheel."</p>

<p>"What is this Pinwheel?"</p>

<p>Callie pointed to another monitor and zoomed it.  "The Pinwheel galaxy,
Messier 101.  Twenty-one million light-years away."</p>

<p>"I thought we would be going to Andromeda," Veronica said with a dry click
in her throat.</p>

<p>"That's what we want people to think, because it's wrong.  Jay and Emma
decided Andromeda was too close."</p>

<p>"Two million light years is <em>too close?</em>"</p>

<p>"It is when the two galaxies are falling toward one another and will merge within
a billion years, and your adversaries live that long."</p>

<p>"There's no gravity in here," Veronica observed.</p>

<p>"There didn't seem to be much point.  It's not like we could stand up."</p>

<p>"Well what <em>can</em> we do in this tin can?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's a lovely coat, but if you don't mind I'd be interested to see
what you're wearing under it."</p>

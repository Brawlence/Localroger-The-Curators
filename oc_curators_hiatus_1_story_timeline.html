<p>Как и во всех других Перерывах, информацию отсюда стоит рассматривать как вторичную;
Если у вас есть идеи для правок, дайте знать — я открыт предложениям до момента,
как мы снова начнём писать канон в Книге 2.</p>

<p>Вот, в моём виденье, хронология серии, которую в Книге 1 я изложил весьма туманно:</p>

<p>2016 -- Narrator and POV character J is born</p>

<p>2020 -- Eventual test pilot, star warrior, and wife of J, M is born</p>

<p>2040 -- Rudimentary fold theory is developed</p>

<p>2053 -- Unmanned interplanetary probe <em>Hermes</em> is launched to test prototype fold drive.  Since human scientists are well aware of the danger of folding the nearest large masses together, they arrange to make sure neither of those could possibly be Earth.</p>

<p>2056 -- Part 1:  An alien fold ship detects the <em>Hermes</em>' early experiments and intervenes.  A year later one of the aliens walks
into J's office to investigate the (as it turns out nonexistent)
human Mark of the Curators.</p>

<p>2060 -- Part 7: Humans launch their first starship, the converted
Harrier jump jet which J will soon name <em>Grasshopper</em>.</p>

<p>2065 -- Part 9: Founding of Providence, the first human colony world.</p>

<p>2066 -- Part 10: Raiders attempt to steal the <em>Grasshopper</em>, and
instead are defeated in the first star battle to occur in aeons.</p>

<p>2069 -- M and J are married.</p>

<p>2070 -- Part 17: Outraged at the way humans have made peace with the 
raiders, the Sevillians attempt to destroy both Earth and the 
raider homeworld Kattegat by fold drive torpedo.  This plan is disrupted
by humans with some Curator help and the Curators use the human built 
fold inhibitor to place Seville under a millenium quarantine.</p>

<p>2075 -- Humans perfect the supergravity microfold drive and build
<em>Trinity</em>, the first surface to space starship which does not 
depend on aircraft technology for the surface approach part of its
mission.</p>

<p>2078 -- <em>Grasshopper</em> is now obsoleted and hanging in the Smithsonian
Air and Space Museum; its fold drive has been installed in the 
<em>Horse Pill</em> which makes a diplomatic mission to the self-named alien
world of Hyacinth.</p>

<p>2080 -- M and J visit the Witnesses in the <em>Horse Pill</em> and at first
do not realize that they have been made provisionally immortal as 
they bring back the gift of a more prosaic life extension drug for
all other humans.</p>

<p>2084 -- M performs the first space flight tests on the large 
landing-capable nanite based Hyacinth-built and human drive-outfitted
ship <em>Laputa</em>.  After these tests are completed M and J retire.</p>

<p>2085 -- Humans begin operating the <em>Laputa</em> as the Hyacinth Consortium
prepares to produce human tech supergravity drives of its own.</p>

<p>2095 -- Humanity operates a dozen <em>Laputa</em> class giant fold ships and
is using them to evacuate those areas of Earth most vulnerable to
the devastating effects of global warming to the colonies.  Earth is
also the center of a growing galactic banking system as it is the
only source in the galaxy for advanced fold drives and other high
performance miniature electronics.  Earth's governments have
consolidated into a shrinking number of authoritarian superpowers,
although a single world government hasn't quite managed to assert
itself.</p>

<p>2120 -- M and J are no longer able to hide the fact that they have
been steadily getting more youthful since their visit to the Witnesses
in 2080, and this is an effect the regular life extension drug does
not provide.  It is now openly acknowledged that the governments of
Earth's major geopolitical powers are the descendants of criminal
gangs who answer to nobody except, in limited form, each other, and
M and J must flee Earth to avoid being captured and dissected by 
those who would seek to steal their gift.  At the suggestion of the
Curators, M and J make their way to Prometheus.</p>

<p>2160 -- M and J complete the Curation of Prometheus by guiding the
Prometheans to the development of their own supergravity and fold 
drives, and the Curators take note.</p>

<p><em>I have done spot checks to make sure these dates line up with the
relationships in the source, but the source is also now over 80,000
words so it is quite possible I have missed something.  If you spot
anything like that please let me know so that I can fix it.</em></p>

<p><em>Спекуляции во время Перерывов не являются каноничными, пока я не впишу их в саму историю.
Через неделю или две я надеюсь закончить современную (2160 н.э.) статью Википедии
про то, как развивалась геополитическая ситуация Земли.</em></p>

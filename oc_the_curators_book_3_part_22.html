<p>Weeks went by with no useful ideas on how to find the Curators' Manufactory.  Then Jay came to visit as Emma had promised, and he brought Agent Veronica with him.  She returned to Earth and told Callie of the problem.  Shortly after that Callie showed up on Terminus hailing me on the microfold.</p>

<p>I met her at the spaceport cafe.  The spaceport had been one of the first installations completely restored after the solar bomb attack and from there it was almost possible to pretend that the attack had never occurred.</p>

<p>"There is only one way to find this Manufactory," she said as we ate bagels.  "We have to follow an implant home."</p>

<p>"There are problems with that," I said.  "We only have one implant that nobody is using for rather personal intended purposes, and if we lose it we'll have zero.  We also can't be sure of being <em>able</em> to follow it.  A ship isn't as agile as something that small, and we aren't making nanoassembled drives any more because of the demands of the diaspora so our drives aren't as agile as they once were."</p>

<p>"How long has it been since you learned anything from your Swiss cheese implant that you didn't already know?"</p>

<p>"Long before the attack," I admitted.</p>

<p>"You need a nanoassembled drive.  A drive that isn't concealed in a fold bubble like an implant so it can interact directly with our universe's space-time.  A drive that isn't compromised by its error-corrective construction technique.  And a small working aperture so it can form folds fast.  <em>Petunia</em> can form a fold in picoseconds, and it's <em>smaller</em> than an implant.  There's no way it couldn't follow your implant home."</p>

<p>"<em>Petunia</em> is also unarmed," I reminded her, although I was also kicking myself for forgetting about all that.  There were three other drives like hers, but they had all been used to equip much larger vessels that had important duties back at the Milky Way.</p>

<p>"This is about figuring out where the damn thing is," she said, and her eyes blazed.  She had obviously already made up her mind.  "I have an interstellar-capable implant now.  And once we know where the fucking thing is you can send in the cavalry."</p>

<p>I stalled her for a week but couldn't think of any reasonable objection to her plan.  I offered to go with her, but she pointed out that she didn't know where she might end up and needed to use the extra space in Petunia's tank for provisions and instruments.  I pointed out that she wouldn't be able to EVA and would go unconscious in twenty seconds if she had to open the hatch for any reason, and she just shrugged.</p>

<p>So in the end we loaded the implant onto the vacuum skirt of the <em>Bellerophon</em> right next to <em>Petunia</em> and with Callie ready at the helm of her ship we set sail for the Milky Way.  We weren't quite sure just how close we'd have to get for it to pick up the scent and head home, and indeed we were still nearly two hundred thousand light-years from home when the implant disappeared -- and picoseconds later, simultaneously as far as all the surveillance could tell, so did <em>Petunia</em> with Callie and her instruments inside its suction tank.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Petunia</em> took Callie on a wild ride as she watched virtual monitors through her implant in disbelief.  The Curator implant was folding every eight seconds.  <em>Petunia</em> was keeping up but it was folding through areas of severely distorted post-fold space-time, racking up navigational errors with each step.  She was following the implant successfully, but by the time the folding stopped her estimate of where she had folded <em>to</em> might have been off by as much as two thousand light-years.</p>

<p>And there was nothing around.</p>

<p>She was far above the plane of the galactic ecliptic in the Milky Way's diffuse halo, and there was only one relatively nearby star to be seen.  The implant had apparently scooted off via some non-fold method like supergravity.  But to where?</p>

<p>It took some careful scanning with <em>Petunia</em>'s sensitive outside cameras for her to realize that she was actually less than a light-minute away from a large rocky planet.  At first she thought that this might be a rogue world that had been ejected from its star system.  That would certainly make a good hiding place because she wasn't sure how she would ever find it again.  With some careful dead reckoning back toward the galaxy and adjustment when she located a known navigational point she might have been able to knock her navigational error down to a light-year or two, but locating an Earth-sized world with no star even at that distance would be almost impossible.</p>

<p>The implant had done it of course, but this might be another technology the Curators had that humans hadn't yet achieved.</p>

<p>More careful scans at different wavelengths revealed that the planet was surrounded by a swarm of thousands of faintly glowing fireflies.  Most of these formed a rough sphere between one and two planetary diameters out from the surface, but there  was also activity near and possibly on the surface.  She formed the theory that these points of dim light were assembly stations, being serviced by something that used the central world to provide raw material.  If it was extreme cold and mechanical quiet that were needed for the Curators' methods of nanoassembly, it was hard to imagine a more perfect arrangement.</p>

<p>And for Callie, everything about it was bad.  Just finding this world again once she returned home would be a miracle.  And there was no nearby star to use for a sunlight bomb attack, and even if there were the mass of the planet would shield many of the stations from any conceivable first strike.  She was starting to worry that they really had thrown the implant away for nothing.  Worse, when the Manufactory realized how the implant had been tampered with, they might take pre-emptive defensive measures.</p>

<p>She slept briefly and when she woke up turned her attention to the one individual star that was visible.  It might be possible to use it as some kind of navigational way point, but as she was aiming the spectrograph at it she realized that it was faintly blinking every few seconds, like an aircraft beacon.</p>

<p>It took her only a few seconds to realize it had to be a neutron star.  It wasn't at an interstellar distance at all; the nearby planet must be in orbit around it.</p>

<p>And to be pulsing so slowly, it must have been a very <em>old</em> neutron star.  She recalled that the Manufactory was supposed to be seven billion years old.</p>

<p>But the Manufactory wasn't a single thing as we had thought, it was a swarm, and a swarm could be dispersed if it was disturbed, particularly if all those individual elements were capable of folding.  It had to be destroyed all at once.  And as she thought about the possibilities, Callie realized that there might be a way to do that.  And very likely only <em>one</em> way.</p>

<p>She spent nearly half a day in a large virtual workspace created by her implant.  She looked up the properties of neutron stars and planets and made a detailed study of the capabilities of <em>Petunia</em>'s fold drive.  She set up scenarios and ran virtual tests and ran them again and again until the thing she had thought of seemed more than ninety-nine percent likely to succeed.  Then she created a new virtual room and started writing code to run on the onboard computer of <em>Petunia</em>'s fold drive.</p>

<p>There were not a lot of people who could pull off what Callie had thought of doing, but she had learned fold theory from Emma herself, who had been on the team that worked it out from first principles for humanity.  So Callie knew more about edge case fold theory than any living Curator had in aeons.</p>

<p>Any attack from outside of the planet would be shielded for many of the assembly stations by the mass of the planet itself, no matter how violent the attack was, and some of the stations in space might escape just as the <em>Wall Street</em> had escaped the attack on Terminus.  So the destructive energy had to come from the <em>center</em> of the planet so it would hit everything at once.  This was itself an extraordinarily hot and violent place that would roast and crush the fold drive in nanoseconds -- but <em>Petunia</em>'s fold drive could form a fold in <em>picoseconds</em>.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the middle of all the calculations Callie realized that she was preparing to commit suicide.  Once she sacrificed her fold drive to turn it into a weapon <em>Petunia</em> would be dead in space.  And while Callie's implant could fold her body as far as a thousand light years, it couldn't fold something as large as <em>Petunia</em> at all and that was a hundredth of the range she needed to find another habitable environment.  She would not survive her own attack and it was unlikely that anyone would ever even know what she had done.  </p>

<p>And she decided she was comfortable with that.  She was in the place to do the job with the skills and the tool that were needed to do it, and it would be a betrayal of everything she had once and still cared about to waste the opportunity.  She kept working.</p>

<p>When the calculations were done, the calibrations were triple-checked, and there was nothing left to do but execute her plan, Callie said aloud "All right motherfuckers, let's go visit Aunt Sofia together," and she gave her machines the command.</p>

<p>There are basically four types of fold operation based on what happens after the fold device draws two distantly separated volumes of space-time near to one another through a higher dimensional realm.  The simplest and most common operation is a push; the contents of the two aperture volumes are merged together and forced to re-emerge in the volume away from the fold source.  Curator nanite drives can only perform push folds.</p>

<p>Equally simple but less useful, the pull fold merges the two aperture volumes and brings them back to the fold source.  Unless the destination is vacuum, which would be pretty useless, this destroys the fold drive by merging it with the contents of the target volume.  But that can still be useful; the Curators' solar corium bomb is a pull device.</p>

<p>The microfold brings the two apertures to proximity but doesn't allow them to contact, and modulates their proximity in such a way as to allow certain particles to cross over by quantum tunneling.  Microfolds are always bidirectional, like space-time itself as far as the radiation is concerned.</p>

<p>Finally it is theoretically possible to flip the two aperture volumes past one another, arranging for them to exchange positions without merging.  Only drives which are nanoassembled have the quickness to arrange such an exchange fold.  Implants can do it which is how a Curator can disappear without a pop as air collapses back on the resulting vacuum, but their range and aperture are limited.  The original human made lithographic drives couldn't make an exchange, and neither can Promethean glass drives.</p>

<p>But <em>Petunia</em>'s nanoassembled fold drive could do an exchange.  More importantly it could do one and then do another fold less than a nanosecond later because it was so small that signals took little time to cross its physical body.</p>

<p>At Callie's command the fold drive disappeared from its socket, and a battery icon popped up in her virtual display space which immediately moved from 100% to 99%.  Without its fold drive <em>Petunia</em> only had enough chemical battery power to stay habitable for a few hours, but Callie didn't expect to die in the dark.</p>

<p>Some distance from the craft there was a silent explosion; the drive had pushed itself out a hundred kilometers, then executed an exchange with a small aperture at the core of the planet.  The bit of hot compressed planetary core that replaced the drive contained the energy of about a hundred tons of TNT, comparable to the smallest nuclear weapons.  It would have instantly and painlessly killed her if she had just let it appear within the ship, but she wanted to see if she could perceive what she had done before it destroyed her.</p>

<p>The drive would have of course been destroyed within nanoseconds of its arrival at the center of the planet, but it made another fold within picoseconds, pulling an aperture from the center of the neutron star.  Callie's implant detected all three folds so she knew the sequence had been successful.  She wondered if the Manufactory even bothered to run fold detectors, since she saw no sign of any reaction among the myriad points of light surrounding the dark world.</p>

<p>The core of the planet may have been a crushing cauldron to the normal matter of the fold drive, but to the 1.3 kilometer diameter sphere of degenerate neutronium which suddenly appeared in the fold drive's place it might as well have been the hard vacuum of outer space.  </p>

<p>Freed from the gravity of their parent star the neutrons began decaying into charged particles and making their way outward.  The relatively diffuse mass of the planet was not up to the task of stopping them.</p>

<p>Callie didn't know how long it would take the energy of the neutronium to start affecting the planet's surface.  Through her virtual ship-senses she watched for about half a minute before lights on the surface mostly went out all at once.  Then she saw the planet begin to both bulge and glow.  The bulge accelerated and the glow brightened through the spectrum from red to orange to white.  The planet swallowed the lights working in space near its surface and still its expansion accelerated.  Callie wondered just how much she would be able to see before she died when instead she found herself floating naked in space as the air whistled out of her lungs.</p>

<p><em>Okay implant, cool move, but what now?</em> she managed to think before she lost consciousness.</p>

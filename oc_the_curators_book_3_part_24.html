<p>This time I left the amplifier with Callie while I returned to the Curators.  She wouldn't have any use for it, but as Emma had done during my first reconaissance she could use her implant to hold onto it for me so it wouldn't be present to arouse the Curators' suspicions as I moved among them.</p>

<p>I had lived on Station C long enough to know where to fold to avoid being noticed instead of being welcomed.  It didn't really matter who I delivered my gift to since it would spread rapidly like an infection, but there were certain individuals I wanted to make <em>sure</em> got the benefit.  Fortunately Curators don't take much notice of local fold activity in busy venues like the asteroid stations.</p>

<p>Station B was also easy and even easier because there were no specific individuals there I cared about.  The other asteroid stations were trickier because I had never visited them, but I have Curator vacuum defenses so I was able to fold to nearby space and do a quick scan before deciding how to board.  Again, in those places it didn't matter too much who I got close to first.</p>

<p>I had tested the worm code by passing harmless payloads between myself, Emma, and Jay, as I learned the practice of hostile programming from those humans who had honed it to a fine art.  But this payload was the fold following shutoff, followed by randomizing the access code which would be necessary to make further changes in that setting block.  There was almost certainly a way to bypass and override that change, but as far as I could tell that knowledge had been carefully safeguarded by leaving it only at the Manufactory.  If the Curators weren't completely bad at computer security they'd obviously have a backup somewhere else, but I was sure it had been a long time since any of them had even thought of things like that, and they would be much more worried about the wrong people getting access than losing access themselves.</p>

<p>All this took me about four hours.  I finished by folding to the nearest indexed world where I wouldn't be regarded as freakish and checking in to a traveler's inn which had been operating continuously since long before the eocene epoch on Earth, and having a nice sleep.  When I woke up I presented myself to the Homeless Council.</p>

<p>They allowed me to visit their world and greeted me warmly.  "There are strange things afoot," one member said after greetings were exchanged and drinks were poured.  "Your appearance here makes us wonder if you are connected."</p>

<p>"I am," I said.  "Pessimist, I think you are owed the right to see this first."</p>

<p>We held up our hands and I sent him the meeting between myself and the Plasma agent who showed me the solar bomb, and breathlessly told me of their plan to make enough of them to take out every human world in the Pinwheel at the same time.</p>

<p>As soon as he had reviewed it he rebroadcast it and the whole group gasped at this.  "This is not who we are," several muttered in every variant of Common.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," the Pessimist said, "It is our Manufactory which made the thing that destroyed Terminus, and this spare which Andrew is seeing, and it is Curators like ourselves who have corrupted our production schedule to make more of them.  And none of us knew about it.  And none of us have the access necessary to <em>stop</em> it.  Andrew, if you have come to us to ask for correction, I'm not sure we have the means."</p>

<p>"That's not necessary," I said.  "We have already corrected the situation."  I held up my hand again, and this time I gave them all Callie's account of the destruction of the Manufactory.</p>

<p>"I have been there," a voice in the back of the room said.  "This is completely accurate."</p>

<p>"The recording seems strange," another said.  "As if it is distorted or processed."</p>

<p>"It wasn't made by a Curator implant.  It was made by a human-made implant.  Our technology is more primitive and a bit different."</p>

<p>"So you're making implants now," the Pessimist said with a W-shaped mouth gesture my implant reminded me was a smile for his current bioform species.</p>

<p>"We have been for some time.  Not enough and not aggressively enough.  Many people could have been saved at Terminus if we hadn't been so timid about rolling them out."</p>

<p>"I take it from the fact that you have the recording that your agent who destroyed our Manufactory must have also survived."</p>

<p>"A bit more extreme test of the self-rescue software than I anticipated," I said.  "But I learned from human hackers who believe in testing software against every possible extreme, and it worked."</p>

<p>"This is consistent with some of the strangeness, but not all," another Council member said.  "Station C folded to a new location and nobody aboard it has their implants any more."</p>

<p>I just nodded.</p>

<p>"Please do not leave our curiosity unfulfilled," the Pessimist said, with a less than faint hint of how his host species expresses outright laughter.</p>

<p>"When the Plasma assassin forced Jay into emergency-mode emulation, it unlocked a repository of secrets which are normally hidden from most of us.  One of those secrets was an access code to an ancient service menu which allowed for a number of test modes.  One of those modes turns off the implant's ability to follow along if its bioform is transported by another fold engine.  This is how I killed the agent that tried to destroy the Earth.  I sent the command to turn off fold-following, then used my implant to fold his bioform to a very hostile location on the Earth's surface.  Without his own implant he was trapped there and died of exposure.  The implant won't go into emulation because as far as it knows the bioform is still safe and alive, and therefore the appropriate seat of consciousness.  Without contact after a few days it will time out and seek to recycle."</p>

<p>"The worm I just deployed on all of your asteroid stations turns off fold-following, then randomizes the access code for that service block so it can't be re-enabled.  It then aggressively seeks out other nearby unaffected implants and transmits itself to them for execution."</p>

<p>"I am sure that there are other modes and codes that can undo this setting, but I think they were only known at the Manufactory.  And it no longer exists."</p>

<p>The Pessimist barked several times, which I realized was his bioform's expression of uncontrollable laughter.  "I must beg you then, please give me this gift!"</p>

<p>"It was meant as a disease.  I can't give it to you without giving it to everyone else here."</p>

<p>"Does it kill us?"</p>

<p>"No, but it makes it <em>possible</em> to kill you.  Trivial even for another of our own kind."</p>

<p>"Even better!" the Pessimist exclaimed.  "This is exactly what we have needed for <em>aeons</em>."</p>

<p>"I meant no harm to you by coming here," I said.  "I simply thought you should know."</p>

<p>"And now we do know," another voice said.  "We agreed to respect the Pessimist's desire on this project, and this is still his project.  If any object, this is the time to say so."</p>

<p>Nobody objected.</p>

<p>"I believe the phrase is..."  The Pessimist engaged the translator and in tinny English it said <em>hit me brother</em>.</p>

<p>I surveyed the room looking for objection, and could find none.  So I gave the Pessimist the fold-following worm, and it quickly infected all the rest of them.</p>

<hr>

<p>By the time I got back to Earth the accelerated bone mending processes were well along and Callie was walking around.  She transferred the amplifier back to my control as soon as she saw me.</p>

<p>"So how did it go?" she asked.</p>

<p>I told her what I had done and as I described my encounter with the Homeless she actually smiled.</p>

<p>"So not all of them are assholes," she finally said.</p>

<p>"I think the Pessimist recognizes what Veronica suspected, that being unkillable is what makes them assholes.  Now they will have to think before picking a fight, because they can lose."</p>

<p>"How many of them do you think it will get?"</p>

<p>"I made the worm very aggressive, and they don't have much grounding in our techniques for hostile programming.  It would be the work of a few days for one of our programmers to make an inoculation by un-defaulting the pass code, but I think it will take them awhile to figure that out.  The main thing is that the real zealots will be at the center of the infection and most of those who don't get the worm will be agents just living out in the boonies."</p>

<p>"I would have killed them all," Callie said softly.</p>

<p>"I would have too," I said.  "But we don't have to be like that now.  Thanks to you."</p>

<p>"I don't even know what it is I destroyed," she said.  "Aeons of progress, burned down.  Am I a monster?"</p>

<p>"You saved a galaxy.  Probably two galaxies.  The Curators are done.  They are already hinting that we should bring in people of our own to manage trade between their Indexed worlds.  There is a sense that we undertook that responsibility already anyway when we distributed the plans for the Promethean fold drive.  The Milky Way is our galaxy now."</p>

<p>"But we left for the Pinwheel so that the Curators could have it."</p>

<p>"They are learning that as a group they will be defined by what the worst of them do, just as they defined humans for so long by what the worst of us have done.  Most of them are not the Plasma, but none of them did anything <em>about</em> the Plasma even when they knew what the Plasma were up to.  So they all made war on us, even the silent majority who didn't realize it, and thanks to you they lost.  I hope you realize that artists of many species will sing of you for aeons.  You will probably live to see an unrecognizable version of yourself being worshipped by people you hate."</p>

<p>"Like the Pessimist," she said.</p>

<p>"Or Yeshua ben Miriam of Nazareth," I countered.</p>

<p>"So how do I deal with this new situation, my million year old friend?"</p>

<p>"I told you once before."</p>

<p>"I remember.  You said to have fun and the rest would take care of itself."</p>

<p>"And it has, hasn't it?"</p>

<p>"I carved a chunk out of a neutron star and used it to blow up a planet.  I have to admit that was pretty cool."</p>

<p>"And thanks to some slick programming on my part you lived to tell us about it."</p>

<p>"Not slick enough to keep me from cracking a couple of ribs though," she said.</p>

<p>"I'll be sure to fix that rounding error in case it ever happens again."</p>

<p><em>This concludes The Curators Book 3.  Don't go away, though!  The Curators Book 4 begins next week on the usual schedule. For those who are counting, Book 3 has ended in the Earth year 2355 CE.</em></p>

<p>At Earth I had Callie take us directly to Mauna Kea, where she dropped <em>Petunia</em> into a bizarrely appropriate parking space intended for a delivery truck of its class.  On the way in I sent the microfold emergency summons and we were met in our conference room by Veronica and her implanted superiors.</p>

<p>Instead of talking I just raised my hand; being implanted they were all capable of receiving the recording.  They reacted in shock as they saw what had happened.  Callie, who was reliving it, began sobbing.</p>

<p>They made the decision to summon the human government liaison who had been given Callie's old human made implant.  He and the Curator representative soon appeared.  The Curator hung his head as I repeated the vision for them.</p>

<p>"Please believe that neither I nor any of my direct associates had anything to do with this."</p>

<p>"I believe you," I said.  I had remained in control of myself for the voyage home in <em>Petunia</em> because I knew Callie did not need to see me losing it as she tried to cope with her grief and pilot the ship.  But now the anger was demanding its say.  "I believe you," I repeated, "and I don't care."</p>

<p>And with that I disabled his implant's fold following function, grabbed his shoulder, and folded him off to the summit of Lars Christensen Peak.  We appeared about fifty meters from the solidly frozen body of the previous would-be assassin.</p>

<p>"Behold what happens to the enemies of man," I said as I pointed it out.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?"</p>

<p>Veronica and her boss popped in in time to hear me say, "I am killing you.  Just as I killed that one for trying to destroy this world.  I have deprived you of your implant and in a
moment I will leave you here so that this good world can finish depriving you of your life."</p>

<p>"I understand why you are angry, but destroying me will accomplish nothing."</p>

<p>"It will make me feel better."</p>

<p>"Will it now.  I will not give you the satisfaction of begging for my life.  I will only say that I am also sad and upset about what you showed me, because I made a promise which is now void.  I didn't want to make the promise but I was instructed to by people I trusted and when you live a very long time, few things continue to mean anything as much as your word.  For what little it might mean I apologize, and if you allow me to I will do anything in my power to help you find the people who did do this."</p>

<p>As he was saying this Callie and the others folded in.  The Curator was beginning to visibly shiver.</p>

<p>"And why should I believe a word that any of you say?  This is the <em>fourth</em> time you have tried to destroy one of our worlds.  You destroyed your own <em>Ancestors</em>.  Clearly there is something fold-happy about the lot of you and at this point I am ready to destroy all of you even if I have to spend the next billion years <em>walking</em> from one end of this god forsaken galaxy to the other to find you all and kill you one at a time."</p>

<p>"I believe you," he said with increasing difficulty as the shivering was affecting his ability to speak.  "And I cannot blame you.  But I can offer you something better than an aeon of futile pain.  Let me help you find justice."</p>

<p>"Like the justice your Ancestors received?"</p>

<p>"Will you also kill yourself?  You are one of us too."</p>

<p>"Maybe that would be appropriate," I said evenly.  "I'll figure that out after I get the rest of you."</p>

<p>"I am quite sure I can find them," he said.  "They won't be thinking to hide what they have done.  They will be <em>proud</em> of it.  They have no idea that the fury they have unleashed can be expressed in a way that might ever threaten them."</p>

<p>"If I let you live, you will tell them how to stop what I just did to you."</p>

<p>"No, I won't.  I will keep that secret."</p>

<p>"And why would you do that?"</p>

<p>"Because when I locate those who did this you will want justice, and this will be your only means of making it.  We do not have the ability to do to each other what you just did to me, and our entire civilization will fail in chaos if any of us acquire that power."</p>

<p>"But you will let <em>me</em> carry that power?"</p>

<p>"About that I have no choice.  But so far you have only used it in retaliation for attempts to destroy your worlds, so avoiding your wrath should be something even we can learn to manage."</p>

<p>I was finding it harder to maintain that state of righteous indignation.  "I'll do this," I said.  I pointed at Callie.  "She just lost her entire family.  I will give her the choice.  Callie, you can have his implant for yourself or return it to him.  More than anybody here you have paid for the right to make that decision."</p>

<p>"Andrew, do you believe he had anything to do with it?"</p>

<p>"For his part, at this time, no, he's probably telling the truth.  He didn't put this in motion.  But like all of them he didn't do much to prevent it either."</p>

<p>"There has been enough death today, and I don't want to be like them anyway.  Let me know when our implants are as good as theirs, but hopefully without the part that makes you an asshole."</p>

<p>I nodded at Veronica, who had caught the implant and who now guided it back to the Curator.  "Unfortunately I think it's the part that makes you unkillable that also makes you an asshole," she said.</p>

<p>"That may be so," the Curator said with a sigh as he reconnected.  "Could we maybe continue this back in Hawai'i?"</p>

<p>"Do you want to collect your colleague?" I asked, pointing at the body of the assassin.</p>

<p>"I have no quarrel with how you handled that," he said.  "That can be your first indication that I will try to handle this other matter in a way that you may find satisfactory."</p>

<hr />

<p>Callie's papercrete dome had collapsed during her tenure on Terminus, but she plunged herself into a project to build herself a new one that would be more resistant to Australia's new rain patterns.  The government welcomed her back to her old homestead on what had once been the Red Prince's estate, but the arid desert had become a mix of grassy fields and evergreen forest tracts.  She had to hire a bulldozer to clear a site for her new house.</p>

<p>The hemisphere of Terminus that had been completely vaporized and melted cooled down quickly since there was no ongoing source of energy to replace what radiated away, and within six months DENT nanites were at work restoring the atmosphere.  While the blast wave had been universally lethal to living things on the other hemisphere many of the buildings and machines there had survived with only minor damage, including the labs where we had been working on implant technology.  Since our work was no longer secret we had no shortage of volunteers to pick up and continue that work once the surface was habitable again.</p>

<p>We completed the work of evacuating the human colonies of the Milky Way, but we stabilized the population of the Earth at three hundred million.  Our Curator liaison did not complain about this.</p>

<p>I had to quickly formulate new rules for the defense networks.  Arriving starships now had to fold to the outer system, at least twelve astronomical units out; we judged that this would be a safe distance should an incoming fold be bearing solar corium instead of a ship.  We could judge the range of a forming fold much better than its exact endpoint coordinates, so in-system folds were completely forbidden within a range of one-tenth to three astromical units to prevent corium from being folded from our own star to the vicinity of the Earth.  This would allow ships that had folded to the outer system to complete their journey to Earth with one more fold.  Similar rules were propagated throughout the defense networks of our worlds at M101.</p>

<p>Personal implant scale folds were another problem; we could restrict them to short ranges and allow them from interstellar space, but we couldn't prevent an interstellar arrival from being an attack.  And a personal scale fold could still deliver enough corium to destroy a large city.  I decided to leave that smaller gate unguarded until I figured out a good way to block it without making implants useless.</p>

<p>After Terminus we rapidly expanded our manufacturing capacity and never made another implant that wasn't capable of interstellar folding.</p>

<p>There was a brief consideration to pick another world to replace Terminus as our gateway to the Pinwheel, but the DENT nanites had made the atmosphere breathable again within less than a year of the attack and we were soon reopening many of the facilities that had not been completely destroyed.  Some people were even defiantly repopulating the scarred hemisphere, on the confident assumption that life would eventually erase the scar.  Particularly with some help from DENT technology.</p>

<p>I had a lot to do and was spending more of my time on Terminus than on Earth, and so the Curator liaison had to find me.</p>

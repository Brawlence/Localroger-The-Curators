<p>Nearly all of the Earth's electric power is produced by Sunlight Furnace powered steam turbine systems. 
Electricity is no longer transmitted long distances; those generators tend to run in pairs, so that they can be taken down for maintenance one at a time.  During the twenty minutes the fold inhibitor was online, they all went down at the same time, everywhere on Earth.</p>

<p>At that time there were twelve alien fold ships in orbit.  All of them obviously lost their ability to leave, but they also lost power, communications, and artificial gravity.  Dozens of aliens were injured when the gravity plating suddenly came back on.  Most of them were from civilizations that do not recognize the value of a money reward as relief for such an insult, and it started a slew of interplanetary diplomatic incidents.</p>

<p>By the time we visited the Australian PM, everyone was in agreement that no matter what the Royal Couple might do, if anyone turned on another fold inhibitor it would be nuked without hesitation.</p>

<p>During those first weeks of our project alien ships and individuals came and went as they always did; with Earth being the only source for its unique fold drives the trade had made it one of the most cosmopolitan worlds in the galaxy.  But now more of those aliens who were coming to spend some time on Earth were actually Curators.  We never knew which ones or how many.  But three days after our visit to the Australian PM we came home from the grocery store in Terlingua to find our old friend the human-form Curator waiting for us in our living room.  This time he had brought a fifth of fine Australian single-malt Scotch.</p>

<p>"I heard you two had developed a taste for this," he said as he poured.</p>

<p>"We didn't realize so many of the distillers had moved from Scotland to Australia."</p>

<p>"Well, they had to move <em>somewhere</em> after the Gulf Stream shut down and Europe started freezing over and unlike a lot of people everyone wanted them.  Australia didn't have the very best climate for their raw materials but they were looking at the politics too."</p>

<p>"So what brings you to the heart of the dark empire?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"Well you two, obviously.  We realize the next move your opponents will make is to try to hide themselves.  The microfold makes this a fool's game, but it does require rather a lot of effort to track who is moving where and doing what.  We have moved a few people in to help with this.  We will keep you updated as to who is actually running things in each of the powers."</p>

<p>"I love the irony," Emma said.  "This world thinks it is the greatest surveillance state in the galaxy, but we're using tech they can't imagine to surveil <em>them</em>."</p>

<p>"Even those of us who opposed your elevation generally see the humor in that," he said.  "It made the approval for this operation a lot easier to secure.  We won't be acting on your behalf, or anticipating what you will do with the information we provide.  But it's a natural question for us to wonder who is actually running one of the most important worlds in our garden, and of course we'd share that information with any of our colleagues."</p>

<p>They tried setting up shadow governments in deep underground bunkers.  They tried setting up shadow governments on islands half-way around the world from their old capitol.  They tried setting up hapless front men to bait us while the real leaders ruled from the back of the room.  They tried pretending the real power was with a committee or legislative body, but there was always someone calling the shots; none of these rulers remembered how to do it without a dictator at the center of things.</p>

<p>We made eleven more people disappear.  We had to pace our activities by the fold ship traffic.  Fortunately what we were doing didn't have much effect on day to day commerce; we were just working our way through the people who saw the disappearance of their former masters as an opportunity for advancement.  It took a few examples for them to realize what advancement would really mean.  And the aliens didn't connect the dots to realize that for the time being a visit to earth might mean leaving with an extra crazy human passenger; that isn't the sort of thing they would waste precious microfold bandwidth to discuss.</p>

<p>Finally we were informed that the Japanese genuinely seemed to have failed to find another civilian leader, and that one of their top generals seemed to be running the things that continued to run.  Although he insisted he was not the first counsel and did not hold that office's power, he also secluded himself as the Australian PM had as if he was waiting for visitors.</p>

<p>We did not disappoint him.  "They say nobody has ever seen you appear," he said when he realized he was no longer alone.</p>

<p>"We try to be discreet," I said.</p>

<p>"Abducting all of our leaders is discreet?"</p>

<p>"Indiscreet would be killing you all," Emma said.  "That was tempting, but we are here because this world has seen far too much death already."</p>

<p>"I never sought to be the supreme leader of my country," he said.  "I only sought to serve my people and to protect the balance of power that has been in place for this last century.  Tell me what I must do to continue to do that, and to see my wife and children again tonight."</p>

<p>"I thought we were clear on that," I said.  "You must bend the knee and accept us as your rulers."</p>

<p>Without hesitation, he knelt.  "I serve by your command," he said.  "That is easy for me to declare since there is now nobody else willing to accept my allegiance.  I cannot promise what my supposed followers will do, though.  They will probably kill me as a traitor."</p>

<p>"We will give you such protection as we can," I said.  "It's not perfect, but we hope you realize it is considerable.  For now our instruction to you is to contact the Australians.  They are forming a new government according to our specification; you will offer your military to protect them and ask for their guidance to rule your lands."</p>

<p>"What if our people refuse to go along?"</p>

<p>"Part of our specification is that most governance will be local and democratic.  Earth does not need an authoritarian supreme leader.  The Australians will add representatives of your people to the council they are forming, which will mostly be concerned with matters of global trade, production, the environment, and human rights.  Your people will have no reason to fear oppression.  If things ever tilt in that direction they know we will intervene."</p>

<p>"Our King and Queen?  Isn't <em>that</em> authoritarian?"</p>

<p>"It would be if we really intended to rule.  But once we have set you up to rule yourselves, our only real function will be to make sure nobody else tries to take our position."</p>

<p>The Curators also kept tabs on the leaders we had exiled.  None of the alien races bothered to maintain the kind of security and identity systems that humans take for granted, so there was no official document trail we could follow to figure out where our ex-leaders might show up.  But every world had at least one Curator living in disguise, and they kept us updated as the out of place human visitors figured out how to live among aliens.  A few of them even managed to book passage to other worlds from which they might eventually make their way back to Earth.  </p>

<p>Three thousand light-years away on the world listed as number 920156 in the Curator's Index, the <em>Implausible Alibi</em> alighted near the door of a traveler's lodge.  Quentin knocked on the door and the Australian Prime Minister answered, naked except for a loincloth.</p>

<p>"I thought I was the only human on this world," he said.</p>

<p>"You were until a few minutes ago.  Your King and Queen have sent me to bring you home."</p>

<p>"Pity, I was getting used to this place.  The natives don't consider it an old world but it's shockingly ancient by human standards.  So, have our new rulers made a terrible mess?"</p>

<p>"The usual intrigues.  Assassination attempts, attempted coups, would-be tyrants plotting betrayal, you know.  Nothing the King and Queen can't deal with."</p>

<p>"Then what the hell do they need me for?"</p>

<p>Quentin shrugged.  "You'd have to ask them that.  I just fly the ship."</p>

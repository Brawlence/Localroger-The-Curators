<p><em>The aircraft was built when men were preparing to visit the Moon, but hadn't made it there yet.  For sixty-five years it flew captains of industry and entrepeneurs to the meetings and work sites that would make the human world possible.  For a few years it flew a notorious pornographer, and a decade later for a little while it flew the leader of a popular fundamentalist church.  Eventually it was eclipsed by newer craft that were lighter, faster, more fuel efficient, and needed less maintenance, and one day its owner decided that it wasn't worth the engine overhaul that was soon to be due.  It was flown to Arizona to be wrapped in plastic and stored in the desert in case someone might one day need its fabulously expensive frame or parts.  That was its last flight -- as an airplane.</em></p>

<p><em>Three Months Later</em></p>

<p>Neither the <em>Gift of Guidance</em> nor the <em>Plausible Deniability</em> had a way to recover the air that would be lost to space when the door was opened for an EVA.  Since the <em>Plausible</em> had no airlock it had to recharge from gas cannisters, but even though its cabin was small it could carry a lot of those.  M had been sleeping on them for two weeks.  The <em>Gift</em> didn't have high pressure gas cylinders because the Prometheans had no industry for making them, but it had the advantage of a separate airlock and a biome sphere that held a hell of a lot of air.  Evacuating and recharging the airlock dropped the biome pressure by about twenty millibars.  Still, on its first grand tour we were conservative and used the lock as little as possible.  We wore our EVA suits for the first few days but when it became clear that the ship was handling acceleration and inner-system temperature gradients well, we started sleeping naked per the ship's intended design.</p>

<p>There isn't much that can go wrong with a giant glass sphere other than something so catastrophic you don't really have any way to deal with it, but we were testing the Promethean drive technology harder than it had ever been tested before.  It had to power the ship and generate several different kinds of fold field, sometimes simultaneously.  The glass plate-based Multiplex drive was prone to glow during maneuvers and at ship-night when it was charging the batteries.</p>

<p>Actual area illumination on the <em>Gift</em> was by gas discharge tubes, what humans would usually call neon lamps except that most of them were actually filled with carbon dioxide to provide whitish light.  Humans had once actually tried the same technology at a few places in Europe before the second World War, but incandescent and later flourescent lamps proved more compact and easier to power.  The Prometheans did use other gases, red neon for exits and emergency equipment and lavender argon to outline working control panels.  M remarked over the helmet comms that the <em>Gift</em> looked remarkably like a Christmas ornament from a couple of kilometers distance.</p>

<p>Space travel had finally given the Prometheans an appreciation for voice radio communication, though their techniques were still primitive by our standards.  Our human EVA suit radios used frequencies and modulation techniques that were well beyond Promethean means so M and I could only talk to one another when suited.  But we did have a Promethean voice transceiver in the <em>Plausible</em> so we didn't have to use Morse Code any more.  They had finally developed amplitude modulation for their own EVA suits and realized it just worked better in a space flight work environment, although Morse was still more reliable in noisy or marginal situations.</p>

<p><em>The aircraft was occasionally looted as it waited in the desert, almost immediately giving up its radar and engines but later surrendering interior fittings, control linkages, and other parts that were no longer made for other still functioning aircraft of its type.  Then one day humans found a use for pressurized tubes with windows that the aircraft's original makers had not anticipated.  Engineers pored over old pencil and pen engineering drawings and declared it a potential candidate for their project.  The wings and tail were removed and the fuselage was driven 1,400 miles -- in those days, in the United States, all travel distances were still reckoned in miles -- to a facility where other airplanes had already been made into humanity's first interstellar spaceships.</em></p>

<p><em>The engineers cut the fuselage just past the aft internal pressure dome and just ahead of the bulkhead forward of the boarding door.  They removed the landing gear and installed fixed stands with automatic leveling jacks, since in its new life it would not need to land at high speed and roll to a stop.  The old landing gear bays became deployment bays for exterior instrumentation.  The nose was replaced with a titanium-framed geodesic hemisphere of tempered glass plates.  After the drives were installed the protoship was flown at low altitude under its own power back to the desert where it was pressure cycled a dozen times to three times Earth's atmospheric pressure, and all the joints were then X-rayed.</em></p>

<p><em>When it was demonstrated to the fold drive makers someone loudly snorted "Looks like a suppository."  When it was given to famous test pilot M and her companion ambassador J to replace the increasingly obsolete</em> Grasshopper <em>J chose to name it</em> Horse Pill <em>and it would wear that name until it was scrapped again on the occasion of their retirement.</em></p>

<p>After a quick flyby of the barren inner Mercury-like world, we settled into orbit around the Promethean system's third world.  Unlike Mars it had liquid water and wasn't frozen solid.  What it lacked in the long term was a moon to stabilize its rotation, but it had geological activity, a thick atmosphere and water, making it one of the more interesting candidates I'd ever heard of for terraforming.  It was tempting to land but our mission was more to test the equipment than to explore, so after a couple of days in orbit we moved on to the gas giants, which like Sol's had a rich assortment of worlds the Prometheans had only ever seen as fuzzy dots.</p>

<p><em>After M and J retired the</em> Horse Pill <em>was returned to the desert, its fold drive transferred to a larger and more capable craft to aid Earth's diaspora to the colonies, and it languished for more decades.  Then one day a transaction was conducted, and a flying transport picked up the inert hull and took it to a different place where much of the equipment was makeshift.  The fold drive hadn't exactly been</em> stolen <em>, as its owners tended to think of themselves as its legitimate owners, but it had been</em> diverted <em>from a promise that it would be destroyed so that it could not be spectacularly misused.  They didn't do a lot of work on the old</em> Horse Pill <em>although they did paint it black and give it a more impressively martial name.  Then they mostly used it for covert black ops, which were absurdly easy since most of the galaxy had no concept of human security measures.  And one day the order came through to bring back M and J, who were hiding on a world that had been identified through logs recorded by their original ship's drive.</em></p>

<p>Six astronomical units out from Prometheus' star, the Multiplex drive turned out to be a wickedly effective space heater.  With her instruments M reported that the <em>Gift</em> really looked like a Christmas ornament in the infrared.</p>

<p>M shadowed us in the <em>Plausible</em> as the <em>Gift</em> swooped and dove among the moons of a giant world.  Since the Prometheans had crap for instruments I did a lot of the data recording with my cell phone.  It wasn't ideal but these would be far better images than the Prometheans had ever gotten of their own system despite its limitations.  I had a feeling people back on Prometheus might be taking more of an interest in imaging technology once we got back.</p>

<p><em>The covert refitters of the old</em> Horse Pill <em>had not invested a lot of effort in engineering checks; they just wanted a craft into which they could plug their fold drive and fly.  And the fact that the craft had sat in the desert for several decades since its last mission did not interest them.</em></p>

<p><em>The ship flew well, but it had never in all its history as a spaceship stayed in space for more than four days at one time.  As the Promethean system survey stretched into its fourth week, thermal cycles and continuous atmospheric pressure finally took their toll on a welded seam forward of the boarding hatch.</em></p>

<p><em>M was EVA-suited and strapped in in case there was a sudden emergency on the</em> Gift <em>she might have to attend to, but she wasn't wearing her helmet.  When the seam cracked and ripped loose the split reached the line of rivets holding the forward geodesic observation hemisphere to the craft and the force of over fifty tons of air pressure unzipped them in less than a third of a second.  The hemisphere was blown off and the blast of air leaving the ship blew everything that wasn't fastened down out through the front, including M's EVA helmet which she wasn't wearing because nobody expected an emergency on the</em> Plausible <em>as they were doing their tests on the *Gift.</em></p>

<p><em>She had about fifteen seconds to appreciate what was happening before the vacuum took her consciousness.</em></p>

<p>"We can't raise M," the test master told me as we were doing another calibration cycle of their drive.  "Do you think she might be suited?"</p>

<p>"No reason for that," I said.  I was wearing my helmet, since the possibility of the sphere failing was still not completely discounted and some of the tests we were doing would stress it.  I raised a comm link, and saw a flash out of the corner of my eye.  For practical reasons our suits have strobes to let us locate each other when comms are active.  The flash of light was far away from where I expected the <em>Plausible</em> to be.  </p>

<p>"Can we get a searchlight on the <em>Plausible</em>?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Easily," the test captain said over the intercom.  The multiplex drive flashed, and a bright beam of light arrowed from the drive to the transparent hull toward the <em>Plausible</em>.  The beam wasn't visible in space but the fainter cousin of our sunlight cannon lit up the <em>Plausible</em> like inner-system daylight even though it was almost five kilometers away. It was clear that something was very wrong.  <em>Plausible Deniability</em> was surrounded by a cloud of debris and there was no glint of its faceted canopy hemisphere.</p>

<p>"We're on our way there," the test captain said before I could ask.  Although we had been going a good fraction of the speed of light on our way to the gas giant, it took excruciating minutes to approach the <em>Plausible</em> because it wouldn't have been good to smack it with a half million kilogram glass hammer by accident.</p>

<p>When we got close it became obvious that the canopy hemisphere was gone.  <em>Gift</em> heeled around to orient its airlock toward the open forward end of the ship, and there we could clearly see M, her limp body strapped in and EVA suited but helmetless.</p>

<p>"Our condolences are inadequate," the shipmate by my side said when this became apparent.</p>

<p>"Get the airlock as close as possible," I yelled.  "We have work to do."</p>

<p>As I climbed into the airlock the test captain tapped me.  "Tell me your plan," he said.</p>

<p>"I have to find her helmet, since it's got the only other radio transceiver in the system compatible with mine.  Then I'll expand the fold aperture and bring you home."</p>

<p>"We won't be able to communicate once you leave, since your radio is incompatible with ours and our compatible one on the <em>Plausible</em> will be in vacuum.  When you are ready maneuver to this quadrant."  She indicated to the left of the airlock.  "Just get us within the orbit of our moon and we will do the rest.  You have limited oxygen in that suit and probably no way to recharge, so you do what you must."</p>

<p>M has told me many times without irony that the most dangerous thing you can do on a spaceship is leave it.  The Prometheans got me within three meters of the open front of the <em>Plausible</em>, but even that took half an hour of careful work because at close quarters the supergravity drive interacts with the thing you're trying to dock with.  When I jumped it was with the understanding that if I missed I would probably die in space.</p>

<p>But in good company, I reasoned.</p>

<p>I made the leap, crashing to the deck behind M's body as the gravity plating got me.  All the <em>Plausible</em>'s systems seemed to be working normally.  I gave a thumbs-up signal to the crew of the <em>Gift</em> then hit the comm link button.  Fortunately the debris field wasn't too strung out yet and I easily caught the flash of the helmet strobe.  I unstrapped M's body and, not completely trusting the gravity plating to stay up, secured her in the back of the ship with bungee cords before taking the pilot's seat.  It took about twenty minutes to chase the helmet down, mainly because of the supergravity drive interaction.  I had to basically set the ship on course and let it run into the helmet on momentum.  After a couple of tries it crashed to the floor behind me and I turned around.</p>

<p>Now the tricky part was expanding the fold aperture to encompass the <em>Gift of Guidance.</em>  This required bypassing several safety systems and specifying the new radius in arbitrary units that were related to several normally hidden calibration values.  Fortunately M had drilled me on this before our departure, and even though it required operating an alphanumeric keyboard in a fumble-fingered pressure suit I got it done in less than an hour.  Then I positioned myself near the airlock as we'd agreed and I waited for the thumbs-up from the crew of the <em>Gift</em> before folding us to Prometheus.</p>

<p>After making a stable orbit somewhat below what would have been geosynchronous for them, I hauled back to the shipworks.  The crew of the <em>Gift</em> had no need for haste in their prototype ship but I was on a limited oxygen budget.  After I landed Prometheans poured out of the buildings of the shipworks carrying flowers and paper standards.  We had been living with the Prometheans long enough that I knew their funerary rituals, and apparently the crew of the <em>Gift</em> had gotten the message to them by radio as I was navigating in.  A crowd quickly engulfed the ship, and when I opened the door and emerged with M's body in my arms they opened a corridor for me.</p>

<p>I had seen this ritual several times, although I had never been the bearer.</p>

<p>Since they don't use cloth they had covered a table with flowers and leaves.  For the first time since the disaster I allowed myself to really look at her, and nearly collapsed in grief.  The Prometheans converged to comfort and assist me.  We went back outside to observe preparations.  There would be a feast and celebration in her honor.  News was being relayed around the world by Morse Code.  I went back to the crippled ship and fetched her helmet, which I placed on the table next to her.  It would need to be stripped of its radio before we buried her with it, but it belonged to her.</p>

<p>I took my EVA suit off and put it on its storage hanger aboard the <em>Plausible</em>.  A couple of Prometheans asked what I was going to do with what was left of the ship and all I could do was shrug.</p>

<p>A Promethean funeral is what they call a proper mourning ritual, and part of that is to surrender to the alcohol and the flow of grief and allow yourself to see death from your own window of life, knowing you will eventually follow.  Except that M and I hadn't really expected to go down that path quite so soon; the Witnesses had...</p>

<p>There was a collective gasp and someone grabbed me and hauled me up to the path.  M was standing outside the makeshift mortuary, holding her EVA helmet and looking around.  "Can someone tell me what the hell is going on?" she shouted in English.</p>

<p>"You were dead," one of the Prometheans said, in accented but clear English.</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>that</em>, she said.  "Is J here?"  I was quickly hauled up to the front of the crowd.  "Honey, the Witnesses have been spacefaring since our Sun wasn't even a cloud of gas.  Don't you remember they mentioned something about surviving the absence of oxygen?"</p>

<p>I had, in fact, completely forgotten that.  But I would never forget it again.</p>

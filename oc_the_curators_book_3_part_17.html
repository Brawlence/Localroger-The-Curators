<p><em>Forty-Five Years Later</em></p>

<p>The <em>Boardwalk Empire</em> was the last ship to depart the human colony world of 
Providence for the new human
colonies of the Pinwheel galaxy, making Providence the third human Milky Way
colony to be fully depopulated and certified for return to Curator control.
Places on the last voyage had been reserved years in advance, and some people
had been waiting for decades to be able to say they were on that flight.</p>

<p>Her gravity vacuum skirt was loaded with cargo, from complete houses which had
been built with authentic hand techniques and local materials to shipping 
containers full of tools, collections, prizes, memorabilia, and anything else
which could comfortably survive a few days in the vacuum of space.  These were
the hopes and memories and future dreams of thirty-two thousand people, none 
of which would ever be realized.</p>

<p>Somewhere on the vacuum skirt -- its exact location will never be known -- a
mechanism which had been scanned and determined to be inert on
loading woke up when lack of air pressure closed a simple mechanical contact.
After that the crystal sphere took notice of each of the <em>Boardwalk Empire</em>'s
fifteen hundred folds as it crossed the void between the galaxies, and when it
sensed that one of those folds was followed by the nearby presence of a 
planet and star it executed its pre-programmed payload routine.</p>

<p>The global defense network which I had built for Terminus took note of this
forming fold event, identified it as having an aperture diameter of twenty-one
hundred meters which was perfectly ordinary for a fold ship of the <em>Empire</em>'s
class, and took no action.</p>

<p>A microsecond later the <em>Boardwalk Empire</em> no longer existed.</p>

<p>A tenth of a second later neither did anything which had been on the surface of
the hemisphere of Terminus facing the <em>Boardwalk Empire</em>'s station point.  Seventy
million people, a bit less than half of Terminus' population of a hundred and fifty
million, died instantly and the regolith and oceans were vaporized to a
depth of nearly twenty meters.</p>

<p>It was more like the fireball of a thermonuclear bomb than an impact so there was 
little solid material ejected into space to fall on the hemisphere which had
been shadowed by the mass of the planet.  But now a flaming hypersonic blast wave was
racing across the surface, to converge inevitably on the antipode.</p>

<p>Of the six other fold ships stationed around Terminus at that moment five were 
instantly vaporized or melted.  The <em>Wall Street</em> had been fortunately in the 
shadow of the planet directly opposite <em>Boardwalk Empire</em>'s arrival station 
point and her captain realized what was happing in time to halt its orbital 
motion and keep it in the planet's shadow on supergravity.</p>

<p>She was also able to tell the survivors on Terminus what had happened.  From the
surface it was not immediately apparent why half the world had suddenly gone silent,
although savagely bright light reflected from the stabilizing moon Aqua Bella was a 
clue.  And she was able to warn them of what was going to happen next as her crew 
detected the circle of fire coming over the horizon.</p>

<p>She then activated a protocol which I had created and submitted to the drive
manufacturers more than seventy years earlier.  Potentially crowded venues like
stadiums, theaters, and ships negotiated with human implant wearers for arrival
coordinates and schedules, usually in dedicated fold entry foyers.  The evacuation 
protocol began 
issuing arrival coordinates everywhere on the ship, carefully sorted to avoid 
collisions.  The ship which had been made to comfortably carry thirty thousand
people on a three day voyage could carry a quarter million in emergency standing
room only conditions.</p>

<p>Terminus had a fairly traditional transportation grid, so implants were not a
universal requirement as they were on some of the DENT worlds.  Only about ten
percent of Terminus' population had them, and most of those weren't capable of
interstellar travel.  <em>Wall Street</em> took on two hundred thousand refugees in a
few minutes and left for the nearest habitable world to offload them.  As it
was leaving the <em>Notre Dame</em> and <em>Chinatown</em> appeared in answer to its
microfold Mayday call.</p>

<p>The blast wave was traveling nearly a kilometer every two seconds, scouring and
baking the surface as it passed.  It was about an hour from Terminus City.</p>

<p>I went to find Callie.  She was with one of her boys and his father.
Her other son had gone offworld to follow in her footsteps as a ship captain.
"Go away Andrew," she said when I appeared.  "You can save yourself.  Go.  None
of us have interstellar capable implants."</p>

<p>"I know," I said.  "I need your help and I don't have time to explain."</p>

<p>She sensed the urgency in my voice, nodded, and took my hand.  We both nodded
a silent goodbye to her family.  I folded us to her old homemade ship on its 
pedestal outside the palace complex.</p>

<p>"You can't be serious," she said.  "There's no way this thing still works."</p>

<p>I disappeared briefly, then reappeared with her fold drive from the display
case inside the palace.  Then I folded us inside the <em>Petunia</em> which immediately
lit up and booted its displays to welcome us.</p>

<p>"I've been keeping it maintained," I said as Callie socketed the fold drive.
"No reason in particular, but I wanted to keep it available just in case.
Just in case of something like what just happened."</p>

<p>She looked at me and said, "I can't leave my family here.  I can't save myself
and leave them to die."</p>

<p>"Callie, I need you to fly the ship.  You built it.  You're right, we can't 
save your family.  We can't save most of the people around us.  And I could
save myself with my implant.  But with your help I may be able to save a 
lot of other people."</p>

<p>Working as if in a trance she enabled the life support system and booted the
fold drive.  "Where to?" she asked with a dreadfully flat aspect.</p>

<p>"Pop us out about half a light-year.  Any direction.  We have to get clear of
the blast."</p>

<p>She did as I asked, and we were safe in interstellar space far beyond the immediate range
of whatever had destroyed our home.  I went into a state of enhanced intelligence
via partial emulation which I had learned to create when I need to work on something
like a computer program.  I sent signed and encoded microfold commands to the
nearest defense networks, which included commands to relay them throughout the galaxy.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"On a delayed trigger -- I can't do anything that would stop or slow down the
rescue operation -- the command I just sent will turn all the defense networks
in the galaxy into full fold inhibitors until they receive a countermand.  We 
have to make sure this doesn't happen again."</p>

<p>"What <em>did</em> happen?"</p>

<p>"We stopped them from putting the planet in the sun," I said, "so instead they
brought a bit of the sun to the planet.  About a two kilometer diameter sample 
of the solar core according to the defense network diagnostics.  At least I assume
it was the solar core; I know it was an in-system fold but not the exact destination,
but I don't know what else would release enough energy to vaporize the entire 
surface of a planet from twenty thousand kilometers away."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"That's what we're going to find out.  I've done what I can here.  You need to
start the sequence to take us to Earth."</p>

<p>We would find out later that the fold ships coming in response to our Mayday
signal managed to save over three million people ahead of the blast wave.<br />
But Callie's family and my constant partner Sofia were not among them.</p>

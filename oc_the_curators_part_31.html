<p>The crowd was light and we easily moved through it toward the council, twenty individuals sitting in a circle with no clear leader.  Their chairs were fixed in place, a bit elevated, and there was space between them for aides and others to walk.  We watched for a bit as an ornate baton was passed around; only the member holding the baton spoke.</p>

<p>The instructor left her student with us as she embarked on some kind of attention-getting protocol.  Finally the baton was passed to a new member, who said "We have alien visitors.  I am advised that we should put aside our ordinary business and hear their testimony while they favor us with their presence.  All signal."</p>

<p>Most of the members held their arms up, and we were nudged into the circle where we met the instructor again.  "Greetings, visitors," the baton-holding speaker said.  "Teacher <em>scree</em> it is good to see you again.  I am told you will introduce our friends."</p>

<p>"As you know there has been no obvious fold ship in our sky for over thirty years.  So it was a surprise when my student <em>scree</em> brought these individuals to meet me.  They took me to their fold ship, which is not made of nanites and is barely four <em>scree</em> long.  They used it to take me to our moon to show that it is what they claim.  They tell me that their people share our suspicion of the tiny builders and that they found their own path to higher technology, which is in some ways better than that we could have ever attained by accepting the tiny builders.  I know little more of their story than that but I thought you should hear the rest."</p>

<p>"Then welcome, visitors.  This is interesting indeed.  Why did your people reject the tiny builders, and how did you manage to make your own high technology without them?"</p>

<p>"The Curators never offered us the nanites, or any other technology," I said.  There was an audible gasp as the translator repeated this.  "The Curators decided our people were too violent and unpredictable so they tried to hold us back.  But we found our own way."</p>

<p>"Do you come here with violent intentions?"</p>

<p>"No.  But we do come here because others would do violence to us.  We stole the ship we fly from them.  We were advised that this was a world out of quarantine where our technology would not attract the notice of our pursuers."</p>

<p>"What was your offense?"</p>

<p>"We accepted a gift from another race which they covet.  They would do violence to try and take it from us.  It's a long story."</p>

<p>"Let us keep for now to the story of your technology then.  You are aware of the Curator gift of the tiny builders, even though it was denied to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, fifty years ago our first experiments with the fold drive were noticed and we were contacted.  Our ancestors, paranoid and suspicious as we tend to be, recognized that nanites were... the translator probably cannot handle that.  That the nanites were elegant but that their true intent was to maintain control over us."</p>

<p>"That is exactly the conclusion to which our ancestors came," the council speaker said.  "How did you manage to make a fold drive without the tiny builders?"</p>

<p>"We had to discover agriculture on our own.  Over thousands of years we often went to war with ourselves over resources.  That gave us a strong incentive to make better weapons, which meant learning metalworking.  Then about five hundred years ago we entered an age of spiraling knowledge of science and engineering.  We figured out the scale and extent and workings of the physical universe and we built vast industries directed toward both war and trade.  And one day we realized the fold drive was possible, and that it was within our capability to build it."</p>

<p>"So your aggression, which made the Curators cautious of you, was the very thing that allowed you to bypass their feathered leash?  At what point did you begin to obliterate their Mark?"</p>

<p>"We didn't have to obliterate our Mark of the Curators.  The Curators didn't mark us.  I guess they didn't think they had given us enough to justify it."  There was an audible gasp from the crowd and some of the council members.</p>

<p>"That is unprecedented!  An unmarked sapient species!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What would you think the chances are that a peaceful race might learn your methods?"</p>

<p>"Possible.  We have already shared some of our methods with others, for things the nanites were not providing them."</p>

<p>"For war?"</p>

<p>"No, to avoid it.  The universe is full of resources, and after thousands of years of war we now understand that there is no longer any reason to be in conflict over them."</p>

<p>"We are not in conflict with anybody.  We are content.  We are more knowledgeable than you might realize; there are a few races which visit us once in awhile, and thousands of us have traveled the fold and seen other worlds."</p>

<p>At this a few council member hands went up.  The speaker passed the baton to his left.  "My colleague speaks a common but not universal opinion.  We are not in conflict but we would also be helpless if others did decide they covet what we have.  And we are stuck in place, dependent on other races to travel and learn.  Would you be willing to share your methods with us?"</p>

<p>M and I looked at one another.  "We would," she said, "but starting from where you are it would be a vast project.  It took lifetimes for us to go from your current level of technology to the fold drive."</p>

<p>Another energetic hand went up, and the baton was passed.  "As a people we are not afraid of work, and we will live our lifetimes whether we live them in endeavour or in stasis.  Friends, are you planning to stay with us for awhile?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we have no other immediate plans."</p>

<p>"Please stay with us as we discuss this among ourselves.  And if I'm not mistaken, this note I've been passed says that your little fold ship is in the courtyard out in front of our hall?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is."</p>

<p>"I really hope you won't mind then if some of us ask you for a ride.  I have long dreamed of seeing another world up close."</p>

<p>We took her and several other council members up about an hour later.  "<em>scree</em> here has actually folded before, when she was young and the last aliens visited us," one of her colleagues said with a snort.  "She just had to do it again."</p>

<p>"Could you show us one of the other worlds of our solar system?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Easily.  This is a <em>starship</em>.  M fiddled with the controls and within minutes we were looking over the horizon of a frozen moon at a gas giant."</p>

<p>"How did you match velocity?" the Councillor said with sudden sharpness.</p>

<p>"We have a device we call the supergravity drive which uses fold technology, but can't be made with the nanites the Curators provide.  It can fold gravity from one place to another to accelerate us at will."</p>

<p>"Nobody has ever had this technology," she said flatly.  "We spent days falling toward worlds like that to do what you just did in a moment."</p>

<p>"Well the Curators have it," M said.  "And built into their bodies.  We still can't figure out how they do some of the things that we've seen them do."</p>

<p>"But you are trying," the Councillor said.  "And that is what we must now do."</p>

<p>We were shown to an apartment a short distance from the Council chamber, and our instructor and student were also given quarters.  We all had dinner together on the ground floor where there was what humans would call a restaurant, except that there was no mechanism to pay the staff, and unlike on worlds with nanite technology the food was all natural and it obviously took nontrivial sapient labor to prepare.</p>

<p>"How are the workers compensated?" M asked as we were served.  Our meal was a roasted small game animal dressed with vegetables.  The Witnesses had assured us that with our enhancement there was nothing obviously edible in the galaxy that would poison us so we dug in, and it was exotic.  Nanite food was good but it was also extremely consistent and uniform, unlike an actual animal or plant.  It occurred to me that Earth might well be the only other world in the galaxy out of critical path quarantine where such food was normal fare.</p>

<p>"They get to have done a job well," the teacher answered.  "Our way of life is such that there are far more of us than there are jobs needing to be done, so there is brisk competition for the privilege of doing that work we do need.  There is greatly enhanced status in doing needed work.  The more needed the work, and the better your reputation for doing it well, the more enhanced your status."</p>

<p>"If we accept the challenge of raising your technology, there will be more work to be done than you can possibly imagine."</p>

<p>"I suspect that is one of the things the Council finds attractive about the idea."</p>

<p>While the Council debated amongst themselves M and I had our own discussions.  "I know how to make a fold drive but I don't know how to make a soldering iron," M complained.  "I know how to calculate the stresses in a suspension bridge but I don't know how to make a machine that could string its massive cables.  I don't know how to make the machines that make the machines that make what I was taught to use."</p>

<p>"Same in medicine," I said.  "They are really held back because after nanites, all the Curators' further gifts assume the use of nanites.  They have no chemical processes, even at small scale, and so all their medicines are natural.  They're very smart about identifying and purifying them, but they don't have very good antibiotics and they regularly die if they attempt surgery.  They would probably live half again as long as they do on average with even the medical technology of our own early twentieth century.  And I don't know any of that stuff either.  It hadn't been taught for decades when I was in school, because who uses a mortar and pestle when you can have custom molecules robotically synthesized and delivered the next day?"</p>

<p>"We've got the basic encyclopedia on the pad we found, but it's not detailed enough.  We need engineering references and textbooks.  <em>Old</em> references that don't assume modern sources."</p>

<p>"You know there's only one place we can get those.  And we can't go there now."</p>

<p>The man called himself Andrew.  He acted as if I might know who he was when he told me that, and then seemed almost visibly relieved when I didn't.  On the shuttle flight to Gateway we spent evenings in the bar bantering with the other passengers.  He had exotic tastes in liquor.  He agreed that I should keep the medallion in my security bag and made no attempt to take it from me.</p>

<p>At Gateway we went to the Curator lounge.  "My implant is Curator, and yours is a human Model One, so we will have to synchronize..."</p>

<p><em>"You're a Curator?!"</em> I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"One of eight I know of with human bioforms," he said.  "As I was saying, your implant is more capable than mine so we will have to..."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, human implants are <em>better</em> than <em>Curator</em> implants?"</p>

<p>He just stared at me for a minute and then said, "You are young, aren't you."  I could tell it wasn't a question.  Then, "I need to make sure our implants both take us to the same place.  If we don't do this one of us will end up in space."</p>

<p>That was a compelling argument to go along with him.  We made three folds to what seemed like random courtyards on different worlds.  "For the last step I need to get permission.  You don't, since your implant doesn't respect the protocol involved, but you also can't get there without my guidance."  This involved some kind of microfold negotiation.  A few minutes later he said "We're ready."</p>

<p>Another courtyard on an alien world, very like Deucalion and Prometheus with nanite buildings about the perimeter.  An alien opened the door of the nearest hall and said to Andrew, "You don't tire of annoying us, do you?"</p>

<p>"I don't think you will find this annoying," he said.  "My friend here has something to deliver to you and he couldn't get it here without my help."</p>

<p>"Interesting," the alien said, and it gestured for us to enter.</p>

<p>I found myself in the middle of a room full of aliens of all different species.  It was similar to the Curator enclaves of Earth, but more subdued.  "You can call me the Pessimist," the one who had let us in said.  "What do you bring for us?"</p>

<p>It took some maneuvering to unload the security bag and there were some twitters and other sounds I recognized as alien laughter as I worked to get it undone.  But the chuckling stopped when I showed them the medallion.</p>

<p>"Impossible," several voices and translators said.</p>

<p>"We were certain this was lost at the Plasma base world," the Pessimist said, and he turned toward the back of the room.  I realized for the first time that one of the beings sitting back in the shadows was also human.  "Were you ever planning to tell us?" the Pessimist said toward him.</p>

<p>"Obviously, I sent my son to retrieve it for you."</p>

<p>"This belongs to either you or <em>scree</em>," the Pessimist said.  At the <em>scree</em> another alien stood up.</p>

<p>"I thought my son might also make that decision."</p>

<p>"You're my <em>father</em>?" I finally realized I should say.</p>

<p>"Yes.  I thought that before I retired to this place I should give my parents and this bioform the thing I had denied them by taking this bioform as my host and let it create a child so its genome and through it that of its parents could contribute to the future of your species."</p>

<p>"But how can you be my father if you're a Curator?  I was taught that you're all sterile."</p>

<p>"Most of us are," he said.  "But when I took this bioform, the Curators didn't give me the mortality Cure, human doctors already had, and they do several things differently."</p>

<p>"Why don't you tell him what he delivered?" Andrew said.</p>

<p>"That is the Amulet of Aeons," the Pessimist said.  "It was made to be worn by the oldest of us all.  We in this hall are the Homeless Council, and our condition for membership is that your original bioform's homeworld must no longer be habitable and your original bioform species must be extinct.  Other than your father, the previous owner of the amulet was <em>scree</em> over there, who was originally hatched just about sixty aeons ago."</p>

<p>"About one point five billion Earth years," Andrew said.</p>

<p>"You've been alive all that time?" I asked the alien, who had red scales and large blue eyes.</p>

<p>"I have had many, many bioforms," it said in translation.  "I lose count.  But I do not lose interest in life, as most of my comrades eventually seem to do."</p>

<p>"And you?" I asked the human who claimed to be my father.</p>

<p>"I was born two hundred and fifty aeons ago," he said.  He glanced quickly at Andrew and added, "About seven billion Earth years."</p>

<p>"Not even close then," I said.</p>

<p>"But I didn't live all that time continuously.  For most of it my consciousness resided in a computer that lay derelict on a forgotten world.  Not all that long ago Andrew and his friends found me and poured my thought matrix into this implant and directed it to take a host.  My first host was a Promethean girl.  I had to sacrifice her early to save... everything."</p>

<p>"We all thought Helen had the amulet when the Plasma base world was folded into its sun," the Pessimist said.</p>

<p>"And that was my intention.  I had actually secreted it on Prometheus, in the place where you found it but a different box.  After this bioform was of age I retrieved it and rented a new box with more security and a better long-term lease."</p>

<p>"I still want to think of you as Helen," Andrew said.</p>

<p>"Yes, this is why our kind fell out of the habit of using names aeons ago," the Pessimist said.  "As we switch bioforms it turns to nothing but chaos."</p>

<p>"So which of us should wear the Amulet?" my father asked.</p>

<p>"Honestly, I think this one carries the weight of its aeons having lived every one of those days."</p>

<p>"That sounds like a fair judgement," the Pessimist said.  "Sometimes the young see most clearly."  And my father nodded.</p>

<p>The crowd made a path for me and I made my way to the alien who wasn't my father, and gave it the amulet.  It put the platinum chain around its thick neck and it clapped my shoulders, which I was pretty sure was a gesture of assent.</p>

<p>Another voice shouted, "Pessimist, this is an occasion and we won't forgive you if you forget to start the festivities properly."</p>

<p>"Oh of course," the Pessimist said.  "You do realize our best alcohol on stock right now is from Earth."</p>

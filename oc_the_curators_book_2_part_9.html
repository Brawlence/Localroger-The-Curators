<h1>A History of the Humans of Earth</h1>

<p>by the Sevillian exile /xxxxxxxxxxx/</p>

<p><em>As excerpted by King Jay and Queen Emma of Earth</em></p>

<hr>

<h2>Prologue</h2>

<p>I will never see my homeworld again, or my family; I will never reproduce.  My world has been imprisoned by a machine that makes space travel impossible, and our sentence will only be lifted long after I am dead.  It took several years for me to understand that this is my new reality and it will never change for me.  Given this newly pointless existence I decided that it would be worth devoting my remaining time and energy to understand the humans of Earth, whose singular talents and nature brought this ruin upon my people.</p>

<p><em>Emma: He seems to have left out the part where his people blew up their own economy to try to destroy two other worlds.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>As recently as 150,000 Earth years ago there were at least four species of humans.  Besides modern humans, who are now the only civilization-capable species on Earth, there were the Neanderthals, which are known through copious fossils; the Denisovians, who are known through a few trace fossils and genetic analysis; and at least one more known only through genetic analysis.  These subspecies were mostly separate but capable of interbreeding.  It is not known exactly what happened to the others, but most researchers, including humans, seem to agree that the modern humans probably genocidally killed all the others.</p>

<p>It is also unknown why the Curators chose not to Curate humans, but many researchers seem to think the decision was made in this time frame.</p>

<p><em>Jay: Well he does have a point about the Curators.</em></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>The first human civilizations which left a noticeable effect on modern human culture were the Mediterannean Greeks and Romans.  While there were extensive earlier civilizations and extensive later ones in other parts of the world, these all fell due to conquest or poor management, and their works were largely forgotten until rediscovered by modern human archaeologists.</p>

<p>The Greeks came first, and their civilization barely rose to the level of having any kind of central management; it was always more of a collection of independent city-states.  Despite this disorganization the Greeks came up with ideas central to modern human thought, such as the idea of democratic rule, the use of measurement and mathematics to understand their world, and formalized drama and storytelling.  Greeks were the first to work out the size of their world and the distance to its stabilizing moon.</p>

<p>The Romans came later and their much more centrally organized imperial culture overran the loosely allied city-states of Greece, as well as a lot of other nearby cultures.  But while they conquered the Greeks the Romans had a fascination with Greek scholarship, which they expressed by copying much of what the Greeks had done into their own conduct.</p>

<p>Being uncurated, humans did not have nanites or their productive capacity, and supporting a large population required a great deal of stressful work.  In both Greek and Roman cultures this was mostly done by slaves, who were humans threatened with torture or death if they did not obey those who had wrapped them in chains.  This was not unique to the Greeks and Romans however; it is just that humans have the best records of those cultures because the most writing and stories survive.  It was simply not practical to have anything resembling a civilization larger than a primitive village with the technology of the day unless slaves were employed.</p>

<p><em>Jay: What happened to the Chinese?</em></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>It is impossible to go further in the inspection of human development without examining their numerous religions.  Unlike the Curated, humans had no idea where their world or their own species had come from, and they responded to this by inventing a bewildering array of pretend stories to fill their sense of ignorance.  There were hundreds of these explanation frameworks, mostly incompatible with one another and a source of much conflict when they came into contact with one another.</p>

<p>The Greeks had a typical premodern framework in which different sentient supernatural beings were credited with various natural phenomena.  The Romans basically stole their entire system, renaming the gods but leaving their alleged duties and features intact.  Other systems, such as the Egyptian, were flexible, allowing that any such deity one might imagine must have a literal existence; humans call these <em>syncretic religions</em>.</p>

<p>A more modern religious framework rose to prominence as the Roman empire was itself collapsing, which posited that a single all-powerful being had created the entire world.  Being unaware of, for example, the fact that there are multiple types of infinity in practical mathematics, their ideas on the nature of this being are quite ridiculous, but many humans to this day continue to believe the stories and practice the rituals they suggest.</p>

<p>Religion remains a prominent feature of human thought and expression, despite their contact and participation in galactic civilization.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>It is difficult to overstate the extent to which human technology, lacking Curation, has been driven by murder.</p>

<p>The great ages of prehistory -- stone, bronze, and iron -- are defined by their tools of murder.  As the survivors of the great European plagues began to rebuild, those methods would proliferate much more quickly.</p>

<p>This is not to say that human technology has never been about anything else.  Humans have a saying about plowshares, used for their primitive form of agriculture, and swords, used for murder in war, that suggests one can be reformed into the other.  But <em>new</em> human technology has almost always been about war, and increasingly it hasn't had a complementary positive function.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>The era which humans call the Renaissance, as new civilization arose following the collapse of the Roman empire, is curious in that their new technology was not directly driven by war.  This is not to say they didn't make war in this era; they made furious and long-lasting wars that lasted multiple human generations.  But they made those wars with the same tools, often even inferior tools, to what the Romans had.</p>

<p>The engines of the Renaissance pumped water to make agriculture and mining possible, and were driven by water wheels and then steam.  The steam engines were the first human technology to be incompatible with nanite construction, requiring airtight seals at high temperatures and elaborate lubrication and fueling schemes.  Of course, with nanites, such machines are unnecessary for other reasons.  This is our first point of evidence that the Curators might have made a mistake in not Curating the humans.</p>

<p>Of course as soon as it was practical humans turned these new engines to the purpose of war.  At first the new war-machines, cannons and firearms powered by chemical explosives, were more dangerous to their users than to their intended victims.  But humans excel at perfecting technology, and in due course their fire weapons were more reliable and deadly than anything ever seen in the galaxy, with the possible exception of a miscalibrated fold drive.</p>

<p><em>Emma: Having seen what a fold drive can do myself, I am not impressed.</em></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p>Humans own self-histories tend to lurch from war to war and from battle to battle without much context for the underlying reasons that these conflicts occurred.  I have tried to overcome this tendency in this account, but there is one individual who must be mentioned because he changed war itself as well as making sweeping changes in the politics of his times.</p>

<p>Throughout most of human history, the primary means of compensating warriors was to allow them to loot the belongings and resources of their victims.  This created several practical problems.  The warriors might be more interested in loot than fighting strategy, a problem that brought down the insurrection of Boudica against the Romans.  Warriors might also be unenthusiastic about attacking a target that didn't have sufficient loot to be of interest, a problem the Romans themselves faced at the point of their greatest expansion.  And the civilians of a land that had been subject to this looting might not be the most enthusiastic citizens of their new ruling empire.</p>

<p>This all changed with the ascendance of the French leader Napoleon.  He paid his warriors a regular wage, as was customary in other human professions, and rewarded their battlefield successes with medals and titles.  These tokens turned out to be much cheaper than actual loot or pay and within a generation every military organization on Earth had adopted the practice.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p>The United States of America was founded by two groups of humans, one of which believed that human slavery was good, natural, right, and justified by their religion, and the other which believed slavery was at best dubious and at worst immoral.  Having organized together to defeat the colonial power that had established and then exploited them, it was inevitable that they would then come into conflict.</p>

<p>The American Civil War was the first war to demonstrate the true power of technology for mass murder.  If it had been the last such human enterprise it would be unique in the history of the galaxy.  Other human wars had claimed more victims and gone on much longer, but none had ever claimed more victims in such a short period of time, often because of the base stupidity of leaders who did not realize what they were asking their soldiers to do against tools of war they had never seen.  The American Civil War inspired a frenzy of inventiveness which had only been glimpsed in the invention of modern manufacturing during America's war of independence against their colonial power.  Because it was so short the war did not see many of its new inventions find practical use, but that would change.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p>It is hard to think of any single fact about human history more telling than that they have had <em>two</em> "world wars," unless it is the fact that they can't even explain why the <em>first</em> "world war" started.  There was apparently an assassination of a minor aristocrat, and after a fallout of agreements and treaty terms a few months later men who had been baking bread and tending smelters found themselves in trenches trying to drill holes in one another at a distance with the most advanced distance-killing machines the galaxy had yet seen.</p>

<p>The event humans call "WWI" introduced submarines, aircraft, and incredibly fast automatic guns into the formula of war.  All of these machines involved forces, temperatures, and chemical gradients that nanite technology could not withstand.  WWI introduced portable armored fortifications, aptly called "tanks."  And at the end of the war, over 15 million humans were dead in fighting and at least another 20 million because the war had destroyed their relatively crude infrastructure of survival.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter 17</h2>

<p>After a world war, what is there to say about a <em>second</em> world war?  At least this time they knew who started the hostilities, two powers on opposite sides of the world determined for different reasons to become hegemonic rulers.  Had they succeeded, as in the American Civil War, it seems inevitable that these two powers would have turned on one another; as it was, two powers that defeated the would-be hegemons turned on each other for entirely different reasons after the war.</p>

<p>By the time of WWII Earth's industries were mostly being run by hydrocarbon fuels burned to drive heat engines.  These industries were vast and dangerous, but they were also universally seen as necessary.  Tens of thousands of ships, each the size of a substantial town, plied the seas of Earth.  Thousands of primitive aircraft plied the skies, dropping explosives on inhabited cities.  The art of destroying inhabited cities would be honed to a craft in WWII, starting with the use of firebombs and culminating in the development of the nuclear weapon, a device releasing the energy of strong-force attraction within the atomic nucleus.  It was not possible to channel such energy so it was released as an open explosion.  The temperatures and pressures created by such a device are beyond the capacity of any defence made of mere matter to resist.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the industries created to create nuclear weapons are staggering in their extent.  One can perhaps understand the scale of the industries that processed oil and coal to create the vast amount of controlled energy which human civilization of that age required, but the enterprise they called the "Manhattan Project" was only ever intended to destroy human cities, and post-war attempts to make the whole technology more acceptable largely failed due to the expense and poisonous effluents created.</p>

<p><em>Emma: Also I used one of those nukes to save a world they were trying to destroy with a fold drive, so is it OK to say fuck that guy in the commentary?</em></p>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter 20</h2>

<p>Without access to fold technology, humans made their own access to space.  Chemical propulsion should have been inadequate for them to launch space vehicles but by clever engineering they made it work.</p>

<p>The Saturn V (for Five, from the ancient Roman numeral system) rocket is a stunning accomplishment of crude non-nanite technology.  Standing taller than most fixed structures in the galaxy, it <em>launched itself</em> into the air and into orbit, shedding tanks and becoming smaller as it made its way to the Earth's stabilizing moon.  Humans also became better than most of us at building remote controlled spacecraft, eventually exploring the rest of their solar system without actually visiting in person.  And when humans began to develop their fold drive, their theorists understood the risk of folding a planet into its sun and they put their first experiments on remote-controlled spacecraft so that if they guessed wrong about the unknowable field constants, the planet that got folded into their Sun at least wouldn't be their homeworld.</p>

<p><em>Emma: If by "better than most of us" you mean "better than any of us"</em></p>

<p>It was my people who had the misfortune to detect the humans' crude fold experiments.  We did not understand just how sophisticated their attempts were, since we had never met an uncurated race.</p>

<p><em>Emma: Sour grapes much?</em></p>

<p>We of course gave them the constants so they wouldn't have to take any stupid risks.</p>

<p><em>Emma: We had already done the initial experiments.  They saved us maybe two months.</em></p>

<p>For this we have been thanked by being exiled.</p>

<p><em>Emma: Alright enough of this bilge.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>"I can't believe you're going to give them five more copies of this," she said.</p>

<p>"We made a promise.  And like it or not, this is how the rest of the galaxy is going to see us.  Suppressing it is not going to work.  If we've learned anything from our own history we should know that.  Chapter 19 you know."</p>

<p>She threw the book at me.  "We can't let this be our record."</p>

<p>"I do have another idea," I said and I smiled mischievously.</p>

<p>One of the Homeless met us at the front door.  "Friend Andrew," its translator said from a language where neither of those words quite meant what they sound like in English.  "Such an unexpected surprise."</p>

<p>"I know, there have been events," I said.  "I need to introduce you to my friend."</p>

<p>"And who might this be?"</p>

<p>"Someone I am sure you will want to meet."</p>

<p>"So few outsiders have our access code that we completely forgot that you still did," the Pessimist said.  "And changing it would be something of a bother."</p>

<p>"I am not here frivolously," I said.  "I came to introduce you to my friend Helen."</p>

<p>"And what value does your young friend bring?  She is Promethean, of the species that invented the glass fold drive, is she not?"</p>

<p>"She is, but her purpose here is unrelated to that.  It just happened that her Promethean parents volunteered their infant child to receive an implant."</p>

<p>"Why would a volunteer even be necessary?  A separated implant makes its own decisions under emulation."</p>

<p>"This one couldn't.  Helen, why don't you show them where your implant's first bioform lived."</p>

<p>Having been drawing and sculpting features of the Ancestors' world for most of her life, Helen had the imagery she needed available in sharp detail.  A few at a time the Homeless leaned forward or made other gestures of attentiveness.</p>

<p>"We know Earth developed such technology and engineering feats when humans did not have the fold, but this isn't Earth and the bioforms you are showing us aren't human.  Where is this world?"</p>

<p>"Not is, was," Helen said, and she looked at me.</p>

<p>I took up the tale with our discovery and destruction of the manufactory at its neutron star, then the discovery of the companion white dwarf and its planetary system.  I showed a few vignettes of our search of the outer system and artifacts we found, closing with the rover.  Finally our first conversation with it.</p>

<p>There was absolute silence as the Homeless took this in.</p>

<p>"They allowed multiple instances of a thought matrix to be expressed at the same time?" someone asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"It was the basis for nearly all of our automation," Helen said.  "The only way we could scan a thought matrix was to kill the source organism, so such scans were precious."</p>

<p>"How could a bioform thought matrix thrive in such a limited implementation?"</p>

<p>"They were edited to an appropriate level of complexity.  It took combined years of labor to prepare a thought matrix for a practical application."</p>

<p>"So you're an edited form of one of our ancestors?"</p>

<p>"When they made these edits," I said, "they didn't delete the original information, they just marked it as not to be used by the emulation.  When we downloaded the rover's thought matrix we were able to edit it back to what we believe is the pure original image scanned from its host bioform.  That is what we uploaded to Helen's implant."</p>

<p>"How could a species which didn't have the microfold perform such a scan?"</p>

<p>"By freezing the brain and taking it apart one molecular layer at a time."</p>

<p>"There are those among us who would have serious issues with this," someone said.</p>

<p>"That does not represent a delivery of excrement," another said through translation.</p>

<p>"How old is this artifact?"</p>

<p>"We have multiple independent geological and astrophysical cues that it was there for about 250 aeons."  This is just about 7 billion Earth years.</p>

<p>"So your presence here is appropriate," the Pessimist said.  "Our requirement for entry is that your homeworld no longer exist and your original bioform species be extinct."</p>

<p>"And that condition would have been satisfied when the star which is now a white dwarf became a red giant and swallowed my homeworld," Helen said.</p>

<p>"I believe this is rightfully yours," another said, and as it approached Helen it took off a necklace and amulet which it had been wearing.</p>

<p>"What is this?" Helen asked.</p>

<p>"This is the Amulet of the Aeons," he said as he presented it to Helen.  "It is worn by the one among us who has persisted the longest."</p>

<p>"I'm just a child with the memories of a single lifetime in my implant," she said.</p>

<p>"But those memories of that lifetime are far older than any of us."</p>

<p>Helen fingered the amulet.  It was a circular ceramic piece set in a metal frame ringed with gemstones.  "Do you know what this is?" she asked.</p>

<p>"All such knowledge is long lost," the previous owner said.  "We know it had something to do with the Ancestors."</p>

<p>"This is a five credit money token," Helen said.  "I could have traded it for a drink or a snack on the way to the lab."  She put the necklace around her neck and looked down at the amulet.  "There must really be nothing left of our home if this is all you have to remember it by."</p>

<p>"There is something you should know," the Pessimist said.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Nobody is certain, it having been a long time ago," he said, "but we are fairly sure the Ancestors' homeworld was not destroyed by its star."</p>

<p>"Then what did destroy it?" Helen asked evenly.</p>

<p>"There was a disagreement," the Pessimist said.  "Some of our Ancestors wanted to find worlds as close in makeup to their homeworld as possible so that minimal disruption would be necessary to colonize them.  But others favored aggressive measures.  There may have been more than two factions; our history of the time is all legend and there are multiple versions.  But there is much agreement that there was a fold war in which multiple worlds were folded into their stars by weaponized fold drives."</p>

<p>"Folded into their stars?  What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"One instant your world is in orbit around its star," I said, "and a nanosecond later it's at the center, merged with the stellar core.  Any fold drive can do that if it's improperly calibrated.  We go to a lot of care to prevent it."</p>

<p>"So everything is destroyed?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"And the people who won this fold war, they became the Curators?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the Pessimist said.  "That is what we think."</p>

<p>"The same assholes who attacked Terminus," she said.</p>

<p>"That would be their heirs," I said.  "But similarly motivated."</p>

<p>"What the <em>fuck</em> is <em>wrong</em> with these people?" Helen yelled.</p>

<p>"Miss, if your implant matrix hails from a world where multiple active instances of the same thought matrix were taken for granted, you may not appreciate how ... disquieting it is for us to contemplate such a thing.  We are taught from infancy that the priority of a thought matrix is sacred, and that it is an affront to everything we represent to risk making a second active copy of one and thereby creating a conflict over which image is the real owner of its heritage."</p>

<p>"And this feeling of disquiet is strong enough to justify <em>murdering an entire civilization?</em>"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, if there was a risk of such behavior spreading too rapidly to contain, I would not personally agree but I can imagine some of us feeling that drastic measures might be justified before our own values might be overrun and lost entirely."</p>

<p>Helen sank to her knees, staring at the amulet.  "They destroyed it all?" she said through tears.  "They <em>deliberately</em> destroyed it <em>all?</em>  What kind of <em>monsters</em> are you?"</p>

<p>"I don't think there is anyone here who would agree with such a decision.  Remember we have all lost our homeworlds too.  But the nature of the technology is such that it doesn't take a large conspiracy to set up a sneak attack.  And in those early days, the magnitude of what was being sacrificed might not have been appreciated."</p>

<p>"But this implant that makes it possible for me remember that world was made by the very people who destroyed it.  This is madness."</p>

<p>"Life is sometimes like that," I said as gently as I knew how.</p>

<p>"I feel dirty just knowing I benefit from their technology."</p>

<p>"Technology is agnostic," I said.  "Your peoples' glow tubes and glass plates do what they need to do.  It's the same physical principle when your implant makes a fold."</p>

<p>"The same physical principle that can destroy a world if it's not calibrated right?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  And the same principle which makes it possible to seed a sterile galaxy with life."</p>

<p>Helen quietly sobbed for a few minutes, and nobody interfered.  Finally she lifted her head and said, "I don't know what to do."</p>

<p>"I think it's time for us to go to Earth," I said.</p>

<p><em>Four Years Later -- Promethean Uplift Project +40</em></p>

<p>The Prometheans had gotten quite good at the unique art of blowing large thin-shelled glass bubbles in outer space, then landing them via supergravity.  The one that was assigned to become the hull of their first fold ship was sixty meters in diameter.  It was nearly a meter thick and massed over a million kilograms; its construction had been a visual spectacle as the slowly growing glowing molten blob orbited Prometheus.</p>

<p>Now the landing supports had been fastened, each of which sported a boarding tube with twin airlocks.  Two of these were three meters in diameter, and one was six meters for cargo.  The hull sat in a new clearing beyond the old shipworks dwarfing the relatively miniature <em>Gift of Guidance</em> and, when it was there, our even more diminuitive <em>Implausible Alibi</em>.</p>

<p>The fold drive was not yet ready but a huge amount of work needed to be done to turn the sphere into a ship before it could receive a drive anyway.  It would have seven deck levels, four of them open to a huge internal atrium.  The entire outside of the ship and the atrium would be devoted to a living life support biome, as in the <em>Gift of Guidance</em> but much larger.  It was much larger than any human-built fold ship but much smaller than most nanite-based alien designs.  The Prometheans refused to even discuss the issue of naming it until the fold drive was installed and tested, making it an actual ship.</p>

<p>The fold drive itself was coming along; it would be a sphere about three meters in diameter, massing nearly fifty thousand kilograms on its own.  But while much larger and harder to handle than a human fold drive, this did make it an artifact that could be manipulated on the surface of a world by reasonably scaled equipment.  In the ship it would reside atop a pylon in the central atrium where it would be solidly supported when the ship was landed and subject to external gravity.  One reason for the cargo-sized access lock was to facilitate installing the drive.</p>

<p>The Promethean assembly method was slow but methodical and allowed for every element to be tested and then for its interoperability with the rest of the assembly to be tested before continuing.  This meant its chances of success were nearly one hundred percent.  Drives made by human methods had to be tested all-up, and if anything went wrong basically became expensive silicon bricks.  The consortium which the Hyacinth had spearheaded were making supergravity drives by human methods, but their yields were in the seventy percent range, and it was widely agreed that if they tried to make fold drives the yields would be far too low to be worthwhile.  Meanwhile Earth's factories were cranking out fold drives even as they had to move everything around to deal with rising sea levels and other climate change issues.</p>

<p>And following after their work on the <em>Gift</em>, the Promethean fold drive would also be what they called a multiplex drive; it would also be the supergravity drive, power source, and searchlight when called upon.  Humans and used separate devices for all those functions, and nanite structures couldn't even make a supergravity microfold.</p>

<p>"These guys are going to change the galaxy even more than your people did," the human-form Curator told us over shots of Johnny Walker Blue.  "Their design is something any world can attempt, with a good chance of success, with a modest investment in infrastructure.  And they won't need to deal with Earth or Prometheus to do it.  Much of the galaxy is simply too distant from either humanity or the Consortium or this place to practically trade."</p>

<p>"They're still going to have to build a bigger ship," M said.  "And a lot of them aren't going to have the Promethean talent at big glassblowing."</p>

<p>"No, but unlike the nanite version their fold drive is still something that can be assembled and transported within the framework of normal planetary surface construction techniques.  And their supergravity-only drive is just as practical as yours to make a larger nanite fold ship able to land, and not all that hard to build for a world of our children that gives it any priority at all."</p>

<p>"Don't tell the elves of Earth," M said with a giggle.  "They might send assassins after you too."</p>

<p>"You know, this reminds me that there is something I wanted to show you.  How would you like to take a little trip in the <em>Alibi</em>?"</p>

<p>"You're wearing an amplifier belt, why don't we just hold your hands?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Because you need to take the ship out once in awhile anyway, and this is a place it's safe to take it.  Besides, I like the view from these ships too.  It's much more fun than just folding from the surface here to the surface there."</p>

<p>So two days later we boarded the <em>Implausible Alibi</em> and M took it through a systems check.  "Where to?" she asked brightly.</p>

<p>"It's CI:649277.  I can get you the coordinates..."</p>

<p>"Not necessary, we have the whole index in the computer."</p>

<p>"Oh, right, human computers.  It's been awhile."</p>

<p>"I'm sure the ones they have now make these look stupid.  They've had close to fifty years to improve the art."</p>

<p>"Not really.  We might make a little side trip on the way back."</p>

<p>But we folded over to the star system of Curator's Index world 649277 in a single jump, over seventy thousand light years away, and to orbit around it in another single jump.  "Their air traffic control is informal," our Curator said.  He directed us to a large city, and then to a flat area of land he said was an airship landing field.  "Just take any flat spot that's not in use," he said.</p>

<p>"Well that's not conspicuous at all," M said as we looked back at the <em>Alibi</em> towering over a field of ordinary aircars.</p>

<p>"You'll see that it won't be a problem," he said as we walked into town.  There was some kind of large elaborate complex in the middle of it with some of the tallest spires we had ever seen on an alien world -- well, if you excepted the Hyacinth skyscraper at least.  The Curator led us to what turned out to be a bar and restaurant across the street.  The barkeep greeted us in a very squeaky high-pitched clacky language, which our translator amulets handled.  The bartender had short bright orange fur and a beak instead of a mouth, and the Mark of the Curators was prominent across its flat chest.  "My alien friend!" the barkeep said.  "And you have brought more like yourself!  Let me break out the good stuff for you."</p>

<p>"By all means," the Curator answered without using the translator himself.  "I wanted to show my friends your wonderful hall of history."</p>

<p>"It is fine, isn't it?  But surely there are more impressive things out there in the galaxy."  The liquor he served us was fermented but not distilled, and had a smoky, very rich taste.</p>

<p>"This is very good," I said.  "What is it fermented from?"</p>

<p>"A mix of local plants," the barkeep said.  "The recipe is a closely held secret of each brewery."</p>

<p>"We have similar traditions on Earth," M said.</p>

<p>"You are from <em>Earth</em>?  The place that makes the <em>fold drives</em>?"</p>

<p>We allowed as to how yes, we might be kind of slumming around the galaxy.</p>

<p>"We can hardly imagine doing something like that," it said as we finished our drinks.  "If you don't mind, I'd be fascinated to hear what you think of our great hall.  I won't be offended if you tell me it's the toy of a small child by your standards."</p>

<p>"We'll be back," the Curator said.</p>

<p>"So what was that all about?" we asked him as we joined the local tourists entering the hall.  To our surprise we didn't get a lot of attention for being, well, aliens.</p>

<p>"This is a world that has a smaller problem than Prometheus, but a lot more worlds have this problem.  These children are our under-achievers."  As he said this we entered a room dedicated to the Curators' Gift of Fire.  It was fucking awe-inspiring.  Take everything humans ever made for gods we had made up in our fever dreams, and translate it to a race that damn well knew who their gods were.  "You call this under-achievement?" M said.</p>

<p>"They have never built a fold drive.  They have built exactly one service shuttle and one power station capable of launching it, and we get the strong impression they did that out of a sense of duty rather than desire.  They have excellent taste and products of their own to offer.  They could be vibrant members of the galactic trade, but they show no interest.  Every year or two another species visits them and they do a little trade and a few tourists come and go, but for the most part they simply have no interest in expanding their horizons."</p>

<p>We entered a hall dedicated to their first circumnavigation of their world.  It was filled with beautiful visuals illustrating the effect this had on their understanding of both their world and the universe around them.  It was unnecessary to understand their written language to be floored by the artistry and symbology that was employed.</p>

<p>"These people have some incredibly gifted artists," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, they do.  We just wish more of our children could appreciate their efforts."</p>

<p>"Why are you showing us this?"</p>

<p>"Because it is beautiful.  And you are in the process of solving a problem for us that we had no idea how to solve on our own.  While this isn't quite as serious, it's still another problem we would like to solve."</p>

<p>Back at the bar, the barkeep welcomed us enthusiastically.  "So what did you think?"</p>

<p>"It's gorgeous, amazing," and we used a few other similar adjectives to make sure the translator got the point across.</p>

<p>"We're quite proud of it," it said.</p>

<p>"So why don't you make more of an effort to show it to the rest of the galaxy?"</p>

<p>It made a gesture the translator said was <em>short laughter</em>.  "Your friend here asks about that sometimes.  There are some among us who want that, but a fold ship is an enormous project and it's hard to see just how much we could gain by devoting so many resources to building one.  It comes up once in awhile, I think the last time was a few <em>scree</em> before I was born.  But the vote always fails by a wide margin.  We appreciate your visits and your business, but there isn't a lot of will here to stick our beaks out into the rest of the galaxy."</p>

<p>We walked back to the <em>Alibi</em> in silence.</p>

<p>"This is a much more difficult problem than Prometheus was," M said as we neared the ship.  "The Prometheans had correctly guessed that your nanites were an instrument of control, and were eager to expand once we showed them how to bypass that control.  These people don't seem to care about that.  It's more that they have simply done the math and not seen a benefit to going any further than they have."</p>

<p>"That's our evaluation too," the Curator said.  "We believe their evaluation is incorrect, but we haven't figured out how to convince them."</p>

<p>"Well we're probably the wrong people to ask about this problem," I said.  "Humans did it all on our own.  We just showed the Prometheans what we had done, and they followed suit.  But the people of this world already know what is possible and don't seem to care."</p>

<p>"Humans <em>once</em> did it all on your own," he said.  Then he extended his hands.  "We also need to talk about Earth."</p>

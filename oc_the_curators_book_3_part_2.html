<p><em>Eight Thousand Years Ago</em></p>

<p>The Curators had recruited a handful of human agents around the time they recruited me.
Humans had already spread beyond Africa throughout most of Asia and even as far as Australia.
Our mortality cure included epigenetic switches that let us modify our appearance so that we
could continue to fit in as humans adapted to new environments.  My beat was the
part of the world known today as the Middle East, and I fit in perfectly as I watched 
humans develop agriculture, cities, and their first nascent empire without any help 
from the Curators.</p>

<p>Normally by this point in a species' development the Curators would have helped them to
acquire a uniform language, fire, writing, arithmetic and arabic numeric notation, 
agriculture, and other gifts, and our existence would be common knowledge.  But the
decision had been made not to Curate humanity before I was recruited, and our presence
was a formality to verify the decision-making process.  There was some surprise that 
humans had attained so much on their own with no help from us.  And without knowledge of
our existence, humans were making up their own stories to explain where they had come 
from and how their world worked.</p>

<p>In order to get as close to the forming nexus of power as possible I posed as a scribe
and allowed myself to be enslaved.  This was of course a sham since you can't really 
restrain someone who can simply fold out of your cage or restraints at will, but they 
didn't know I could do that.  As a scribe I was a <em>valuable</em> slave and as such I became
both the property and trusted confidant of the young King.  I was careful not to 
reveal any knowledge or skill that I hadn't seen some other human demonstrate, but in
order to make myself valuable I did have to pose as one of the most talented and well
trained humans to acquire their skills naturally.</p>

<p>"Learned Scribe, I seek your counsel," the King said as I was at work.  I put away my
materials and turned, giving him a slight bow.  These new royals had not yet developed
a craving for the elaborate rituals of servitude which would eventually become
standard, and it was enough for me to show simple respect and obedience.</p>

<p>"Whatever I may offer, my lege."</p>

<p>"Our crops are in and they are more bountiful than ever.  My soldiers are confident
that they can expand my domain by conquering one of our neighbors, taking their 
people as slaves and eliminating them as a threat to ourselves.  You know exactly
how much we have in surplus, so I seek your counsel as to the best course of action."</p>

<p>This was one of those times when I knew something I shouldn't have known; they were
not rotating their crops and so the fertility of the soil as they were using it was
a finite resource.  And with their population density, which they needed to make 
agriculture practical, they <em>needed</em> those crops; going back to hunting and 
gathering was not a realistic option.</p>

<p>"My lege, your vision has led us to a great place," I said.  "But no one has ever
tested the fertility of our mother Goddess as we are doing.  Should her bounty 
fail in a year or two or three, we might need today's surplus to avoid famine."</p>

<p>"But Scribe, our storage houses already overflow."</p>

<p>"My lege, if the crop fails next year we only have barely enough to cover that year.
We would then have no surplus to expend on expanding our borders to plow new lands.
And that is if we leave this year's bounty in storage."</p>

<p>"Do you think the crop might really fail?"</p>

<p>"There is so much we don't know, my lege," I lied.  "Our storage overflows only
because we haven't built much because we never had such a surplus before.  Perhaps
before committing to expansion it might be prudent to build more storage and 
improve our defenses against vermin so we can build a cushion against hardship."</p>

<p>"For how long should we take such a timid posture?"</p>

<p>"Not timid, my lege, but careful.  We have two years of bounty and we don't know
if a storm or flood or drought will undo us.  I would advise giving it five -- no,
make that seven -- years.  Use the time and our surplus capacity to build strong 
silos of brick so that vermin can't get in and fill them up, so that if there are
lean years coincident with your next bold move they will not undo all your works."</p>

<p>I knew the soil would begin to show its burden by then.  They might be able to
replenish it by irrigating from the river instead of waiting for the seasonal 
floods, but it would take them time to learn how to do that.</p>

<p>"That is sound advice, Scribe.  Thank you for your counsel."</p>

<p>And of course four years later the crops failed, and I became such a hero that
I had to disappear in order to avoid becoming more of a part of the human story
than the Curators wanted.  Even so the story of my counsel was retold and
attributed to other kings and wise men in turn, and with much embellishment
that became my first appearance in the Christian Bible.</p>

<p><em>Present Day: Two Years Later</em></p>

<p>The Pinwheel expedition had built an enormous bulk nanoassembly facility in the
outer Terminus system, anticipating the day when we would have to make a fairly
large implant for every human in the galaxy, but we weren't ready for that yet.
I approached the lead nanoassembly researcher and asked him about excess capacity.</p>

<p>"Out the wazoo," he said.  "We can make one of our current experimental implants 
in about two days.  So far the most strapping model we've made can fold half a 
light-year which is still bollocks and we can make one of those in about ten days.
Right now we only have ten active assembly stations, but we could have a hundred 
by next week and ten thousand by next year.  But there's no reason to bother."</p>

<p>"Check this out," I said, and I took over his computer to show a prototype design.
He looked it over carefully.  "Aye, we could make a few of those.  What the hell
is it?"</p>

<p>"It's an element of a planetary defense grid that limits fold span strongly enough
to resist a Curator amplifier attack."</p>

<p>"No way!"</p>

<p>"When I was tracking the rogue Curator Nemesis I found that even though human
fold detectors were very primitive, a planetary network of them was as powerful 
as my amplifier.  This works on the same principle in the other direction."</p>

<p>"Simple devices," he mused.  "Not much going on in there for computing or aperture
maintenance.  Just a honking fold core and bit parts."</p>

<p>"It's meant to do one thing, but it's one somewhat <em>important</em> thing."</p>

<p>"Aye, I catch your drift.  How many of these would you be needing?"</p>

<p>"With this spec we could probably get away with twenty, but I'd prefer thirty-two
so we could have a little cushion for losing a few."</p>

<p>"We could probably make that in a few months without even ramping up."</p>

<p>"Then we would need thirty-two for every human world."</p>

<p>"Well there's at least fifty worlds here with humans on 'em, but mostly outposts 
with just a few pioneers."</p>

<p>"I'm thinking that after we prove the concept somewhere dispensable and outfit
Terminus, we then outfit Earth and the ten major human colonies at the Milky Way."</p>

<p>"And how would we be proving the concept without a..."</p>

<p>I just looked at him.</p>

<p>"Oh, right Andrew.  I'll get the nanites set prepping some new assembly stations
and some freighters bringing in raw material.  It'll be kinda nice to be making
something useful for a change."</p>

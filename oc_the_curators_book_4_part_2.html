<p>It took over a hundred years after the destruction of the Manufactory to figure out how to reliably detect Curators by the presence of their implants.  The Curators themselves couldn't do that.  On our arrival at Earth all of us had to pass through the detector.  My new friend didn't even bother; it just took the alternate portal to register its presence for the authorities.</p>

<p>I passed through the detector and it didn't make a peep.  After all I had designed it, so my implant knew not to respond to the diagnostic ping it used.</p>

<p>My chance encounter radically changed my agenda on Earth though.  Instead of going off to meet Callie I caught an aircar to the Council of the Five Galaxies in Atlanta.</p>

<p>I didn't have any business with the Council itself; in fact, there isn't really much governance for it to do, what with the distances involved, so it is more about mutual acknowledgement and formal political presence.  But it's where Jay was, since he was doing a stint as the Ambassador from the Pinwheel.  I would have taken the solar bomb to Veronica's old boss, but he had decided to retire and join a scout team helping to explore Triangulum.  Her new boss seemed competent but we didn't have a history.  I would let Veronica tell him after I told Jay and Jay told me to involve her.</p>

<p>"We have to tell Veronica," Jay said after I showed him the weapon and beamed him the relevant memories.</p>

<p>"I wasn't sure how much we trust the new management."</p>

<p>"As much as ever.  They're spies.  They'll be very reliable unless they have a good reason to stab you in the back, and I don't think this gives them a reason to do that."</p>

<p>At the Agency only Veronica was still implanted; the old head was exploring Triangulum, and the research director had taken his amplifier to Andromeda to assist with its colonization.  So we had to actually <em>tell</em> the story to about a dozen managers and agents who were interested for various reasons.</p>

<p>"This is concerning," the new agency head said when we were done.  "We have no idea where the Plasma leaders might have gone?"</p>

<p>"None at all," I said.  "None of the assistants was present when their leaders disappeared, so they weren't prepared to sample the fold characteristics.  There are far more undeveloped worlds that are livable in this galaxy than there are Indexed worlds with civilizations.  They could be anywhere."</p>

<p>"What about the weapon?"</p>

<p>"I thought this might actually be the safest place in the Five Galaxies to study it, because of the inhibitor system."</p>

<p>At that nearly everyone nodded.  "Andrew, would you be willing to stay on Earth awhile and help us study this thing?  Nobody seems to know more about their tech than you."</p>

<p>"I'd be a little puzzled if you didn't ask me," I said.  "And of course, I'll do whatever I can to help."</p>

<p>Callie was living in Kyoto so I waited until it would be daybreak in Japan before sending her an implant to implant microfold ping.  I summarized my encounter at Gateway and sent her some of the memories.  She acknowledged the seriousness of the situation and promised to be along at her earliest opportunity.  She would have to take an aircar to the lab in Atlanta so it would take a couple of days.</p>

<p>We were still doing a preliminary inspection of the sphere when she arrived.  I met her as the aircar was dropping her off at the flat the Agency had arranged for her.</p>

<p>"Did it cause a problem with the monastery?" I asked.  She had been living as a Buddhist monk for at least three hundred years.</p>

<p>"My order isn't restrictive," she said.  "They also know who I am on the outside."  I helped her claim her flat and offered to walk with her to the Agency.</p>

<p>"I was hoping for an aircar.  We're right on the planetery Mall and we'll have to walk past <em>them</em>."</p>

<p>"Aircars are restricted over the capital.  Besides, the weather is beautiful and it's only six blocks."</p>

<p>About a block down we passed the first of the statues.  A plaque announced that this was <em>The Destruction of Power Turned to Evil</em>, and it was a highly abstract depiction of the destruction of the Manufactory.  The Manufactory world was about three meters in diameter and spitted on a tilted pylon, presumably representing its axis of rotation, which supported the whole sculpture.  The neutron star was about the size of a basketball, mounted on a projection which represented a bolt of whatever was being pulled from it.  The world was surrounded by a wad of wires representing the assembly stations supported by outwardly directed spikes representing the neutron star's energy ripping the planet apart.  One longer spike had chevrons pointing toward the planet, and supported a lovingly rendered model of Callie's suction truck ship <em>Petunia</em>.  The artist hailed from the world CI:610220 where Callie had landed after her exploit.  Its name was not pronouncable by most races so it was universally known as the Sculptor.</p>

<p>Callie didn't say anything about it as we passed, but she bristled visibly.</p>

<p>Two blocks further in front of the planetary Congress we came to her statue.  She was rendered double life-size, supported by a pylon that spread out to form the impression of a hand made of energy bolts.  She was naked.  The Sculptor had done the destruction statue first so everyone assumed that its depiction of humans, who were a very alien life-form to it, would also be abstract.  But we were wrong.  It spent over ten years on Earth studying human anatomy and art and when it produced its depiction of Callie, it was breathtaking.  At the moment the emergency system saved her she was naked in space, floating; she had actually modeled for it in zero-G.  The Sculptor had promised her that no recordings would be made but it apparently had a very detailed memory.  She was anatomically correct and her face bore an expression of mixed surprise, awe, and triumph.  It was sometimes joked that she was floating away on a billion liters of adolescent ejaculate.</p>

<p>The plaque announced that this statue was called <em>The Triumphant Sorceress Escapes</em>.</p>

<p>"So is this why you joined the monastery?" I asked, genuinely curious.</p>

<p>"No," she said, and left it at that.</p>

<p>Finally just before reaching the Agency we came to my statue.  The Sculptor had made me half again life-size and I was standing on the ground, so that people could walk around the installation.  I was dressed anachronistically in a suit that would have been appropriate in the 1950's when human computers were first invented.  I was surrounded by representations of early human computers, themselves all at normal scale so that my statue towered over them; there were tape drives, disk drives that looked like washing machines, rack cabinets, and even the iconic C-shaped tower of the original Cray supercomputer.  I was holding my hands up as if summoning, and energy bolts were rising up from these machines to merge above my head and jut upward several meters, where they kinked and made a hard turn toward Callie's statue two blocks away.</p>

<p>This one was called <em>The Wizard Rescues the Champion</em>.  Thankfully it didn't represent the part where my programming error nearly killed her.</p>

<p>"Well, I have one too," I said, pointing.</p>

<p>"Yes, and your statue gets to wear clothes.  And I seem to recall doing a bunch of programming too to get the fold drive to do what was necessary, but you get all the computers while I'm just a sorceress, having presumably used my sexual power to trick the neutron star into blowing up the planet."</p>

<p>"I seriously doubt the Sculptor saw it that way," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh I know it didn't," she said with a heavy sigh.  "But it's just that these fucking things are <em>everywhere</em>.  It couldn't just make <em>one</em>, no, it had to publish the fucking nanite recipe so every inhabited world feels like it has to put one up.  At least there was only <em>one</em> of the one they built on Terminus, and half the teenagers in the galaxy didn't get their first hardon staring at it."</p>

<p>"Are you <em>sure</em> this isn't why you joined the monastery?"</p>

<p>"I joined the monastery before it made these.  Let's go see if we can figure out what your new marble is up to without anyone suggesting I try putting it in my vagina, okay?"</p>

<p>As we entered the building I made a quiet microfold ping to the research team letting them know that there were to be no jokes about where Callie hid her fold drive back in the day.  By the time we got to the lab everyone knew.</p>

<p>"What's the control interface look like?" Callie asked.</p>

<p>"That's been a problem.  We can't find one."</p>

<p>"You can't find the control interface?  Aren't they all the same?"</p>

<p>"Implants, amplifiers, various other devices, yes, the Curators tend to reuse the same tech over and over.  But this thing doesn't respond to any of our attempts to connect.  Doesn't even seem to even be powered up."</p>

<p>I had expected our research to start with hacking into the control interface, so this left us at step minus one.  Short of cutting it in half we were running out of ideas to kick it.  We spent most of the day filling her in on what we had tried, and not making much new progress.</p>

<p>At the end of the day Callie and I walked to my place, which was in a different direction that didn't take us past the statues.</p>

<p>She reminded me that her order was not restrictive in other ways and we had red wine with nanite-formed chicken fingers and french fries as we caught up with the last century.  Our implants came in handy for that and we ended up conducting much of that conversation cuddling naked with our eyes closed, passing images and memories back and forth.</p>

<p>"I still don't understand why you joined the monastery," I said later.  "You didn't seem like the kind of person to be taken by religious dogma."</p>

<p>She sat up.  "Andrew, seriously?  You've lived among us for all these centuries and you don't know anything about Buddhism?"</p>

<p>I allowed as to how I had kind of had other concerns than the crazy internal details of human mythology which existed mainly because humans didn't know about the Curators.</p>

<p>"Gautama was a rich prince who was miserable, and he sought to understand why he was miserable when he had more than nearly anyone else.  He came to the conclusion that it is desire that makes us miserable, and that the only way to eliminate suffering is to eliminate desire.  He came up with some explanations that should obviously be taken as allegorical, but what spoke to me were the rituals.  Gautama spelled out the exercises he used to rid himself of desire, and gave them to us.  So the things we do, the meditation, the Four Noble Truths, the Eight-Fold Path, all of that is meant to focus our concentration away from things that make us suffer."</p>

<p>"But you can't seriously believe that you will be reincarnated."</p>

<p>At this she cracked up with laughter.  "Asks the person who has <em>actually been reincarnated</em> twenty times," she managed to gasp.</p>

<p>"I had a little technological help with that," I said a bit indignantly.</p>

<p>"And I expect you to fix me up one day with <em>human</em> tech," she said.  "But meanwhile, no, that's more about the wheel of life spinning before and after we exist.  It's something I would expect someone as long-lived as yourself might have trouble understanding."</p>

<p>"Not entirely, but in my case it's a very <em>slow</em> wheel."</p>

<p>"But it turns even for you.  Those statues are about the two of us making sure of that."</p>

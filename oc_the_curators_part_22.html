<p><em>Title:</em> At an Ancient Ritual, a New Ship Gets the Party Together</p>

<p><em>Byline:</em> Alpha and Beta</p>

<p>Galactic rotation may have carried the ancient civilization of Gamma [CI:407914] out of the mainline of the Sagittarius arm of our galaxy, but their traditions still require personal attendance of their allies at the ascendance rituals of their royalty.  The last time these reporters covered a Gamma royal event it took more than half a typical lunar month to pick up all the guests, and a similar interval to get them all back home, despite Gamma reserving a capital fold ship for the purpose.</p>

<p>This time they did it in one typical solar day each way.  And what made it possible was a remarkable new ship built by the humans of Earth [CI:1742660].</p>

<p>Humans are as young a species as the Gammas are mature; they only left critical path quarantine within the last few hundred years.  But they are burning a bright line along their arm of the Galaxy.  After building an improbably compact fold drive they created a lot of buzz with their tiny starships, all of which had originally been built for on-planet air transport before being retrofitted for space.  And while those ships could manage the stunning feat of ascent to space, folding, velocity translation, and descent to the surface all in one trip, that trip was described as either thrilling or terrifying depending on who you asked.  Those craft got to the surface with loud air-breathing combustion engines full of moving parts subjected to high temperatures and unimaginable stresses, and while our Beta did take the trip between worlds on one, at that time they didn't even have gravity plating and so it was a bit of a wild ride.</p>

<p>That was five typical years ago -- and, well, for humans it seems five years is a heck of a long time.</p>

<p>We caught the new bus at Gamma, joining princess Delta to collect her guests.  The human foldship <em>Three-In-One</em> features not just gravity plating but a supergravity drive capable of accelerating it at the surface gravity of whatever cosmic object, usually the nearest star, it decides to tap.  It's a much more focused version of our gravity and levitation plating, which we can't make with nanites.  The humans are quite open about how they make their unusual technology, and so far nobody else has been inclined to duplicate the heroic manufacturing effort it takes.</p>

<p>One might at first mistake the <em>Three-In-One</em> for a ground to orbit transport, but its human pilot M joked that the ship has actually never been in orbit around a planet.  "We just don't need to do that," she said as we toured the small ship which has no staterooms and comfortable but close seating for about a hundred standard form bipedal beings in its passenger hull.  "We pop from the surface to near space, make the fold, adjust velocity if necessary, and touch down.  Tapping the surface gravity of a nearby normal star gives us twenty plus normal habitable gravities of acceleration for the velocity adjustment, and we can orient the vector in any direction without turning the ship.  We can be surface to surface within galactic distances like this in half an hour."</p>

<p>While they weren't providing the usual palacious staterooms, the humans did put on a good spread of alcoholic liquors and savory snacks.  While they had a few traditional exotica known to be favored by certain guests most of the treats were from Earth, and offered an interesting sample of their brewing, distilling, agricultural, and meat cultivating skills.  It also became a bit of a running gag among those of us who had experienced a <em>Three-In-One</em> transport cycle to rib the newcomers who hadn't about how terrible the accommodations were, until they saw for themselves how quickly the whole thing was going to be accomplished.</p>

<p>After an incredible run of visiting eight worlds in less than half a typical day, we returned to Gamma with all the guests, landing and delivering them directly within the main courtyard of the royal palace.  There was no rest for our transport hosts though; during the festival the <em>Three-In-One</em> would go back to Earth and do a transport run through their colonies and a diplomatic run to their allies at Kattegat on the far side of the galaxy before returning to take all the guests home.</p>

<p>The leaders of eight worlds have much to contemplate after this improbably quick ride.  Humans have done things in their short years of maturity which the rest of us haven't managed in aeons, a fact that hasn't gone lost on some of our leaders -- including, unfortunately, those of the world Seville [CI:1729140] which earned a Curator-imposed exile by attempting to destroy both Earth and their allied world Kattegat [CI:1659441] with the very fold drive shenanegans they scare us with as kids.</p>

<p>We suppose the lesson from what happened there is, don't do it.  You can't stop change by murder.  And why would you want to, when that change holds so much wonderful promise?</p>

<p>The human ship <em>Three-In-One</em> has only been in operation for about four typical lunar months.  Its operators say it is really a prototype, a conservative expression of designs they know will work without venturing too far out in the realm of what is unknown but possible.</p>

<p>We are looking very forward to seeing what the humans find out to be possible next.</p>

<p><em>Footnote:</em></p>

<p>Those who are unfamiliar with humans might wonder why our hosts are wrapped in so much textile decoration as they attend us.  This was not some special affectation for our royal guests; in addition to their unusual technological talents, humans are known for a somewhat perverse modesty habit and instinct to conceal their natural body form.  This can be most frustrating for the curious, but fortunately their allies at Kattegat tempted the female pilot M to accept and display color honors for her triumphant defeat of their own foldship.  Here are M and J, M without her typical human modesty garments and sporting raider colors, along with exalted raider colorist O in a candid moment on the local planetary show <em>When Not Raiding</em>.</p>

<p><em>End Article</em></p>

<p>The entire article was professionally matted and framed, including all three photos, in the hallway about twenty feet from the Director's office door.</p>

<p>"I seem to recall predicting that this would happen," I said carefully.</p>

<p>"So you did," M said.</p>

<p>"It doesn't bother you?"</p>

<p>"Do you have any idea what this really means?" M said.</p>

<p>"I guess I don't."</p>

<p>"Humans are about to become the most famous young race in the galaxy.  Aliens by the trillion are going to remember Earth's Curator Index 1742660 and dream about piloting tiny starships that can land on planets.  And they will all wonder what a human looks like.  And over most of the galaxy, it will be <em>us</em>" -- she stabbed the last photograph on the poster with her forefinger -- "that they will see.  Not our political leaders, not our rock stars, not our diplomats or our engineers.  They will see the naked female who blows up fold ships and her faithful statesman mate who made the improbable peace."</p>

<p>And with that she kissed me and then turned and walked away, looking as self-satisfied as I have ever seen any human being in my entire life.</p>

<p>I realized as I detoured by the liquor store on the way back to our house that I should never underestimate the ego of a warrior test pilot.</p>

<p><em>1945</em></p>

<p>The six of us who had been watching humanity on behalf of the Curators held
our summit at the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco.  It takes time for 
our epigenetic switches to change our appearance so most of us didn't dare
be seen in the swanky new restaurant on the 19th floor.  Instead I rented us
a generous suite on the 15th and arranged for room service.</p>

<p>We didn't use names so among ourselves we referred to ourselves as "E" for
Earth one through six in the order we had been recruited.  I was E4.  E2
had had the Japanese beat and had managed to fold in in time to catch the
aftereffects of the Hiroshima bomb.  We poured a round of Jim Beam and
he raised his glass.  "To the end of this war at least," he said with a
bit of a sigh, and we all toasted.</p>

<p>But we knew it wouldn't be the last war, any more than the Great War had been.
And the next war would be fought with weapons almost as terrifying as a
detuned fold drive.  More terrifying, really, since while folding a world
into its star kills everything, it does so pretty much instantly so there
isn't so much protracted suffering.</p>

<p>"I have been watching these people for fifty-five thousand years," E6 said,
"and every time they do something magnificent our handlers just say it's crazy
and more evidence that they will destroy themselves.  And they keep not
destroying themselves."</p>

<p>"This may be different," E2 said.  "You haven't seen what these bombs <em>do</em>."</p>

<p>"They don't destroy the whole world.  Look at how they picked up after the
last war and just rebuilt everything and went on.  With humans anything is
possible."</p>

<p>"Up to a point," E1 said.  He was in Chinese physical form.  "They have
incredible constructive technology, but their destructive tech always seems
to lead."</p>

<p>"That shouldn't be too surprising," I said.  "The question is should we just
stand by and watch in this volatile moment should a single individual with
way too much power do something stupid.  We've seen lots of stupid in the 
last hundred years along with their genius."</p>

<p>"I want to see what they do next," E5 said.  "This bomb is a horrible thing 
but it's a <em>magnificent</em> horrible thing.  Nobody in the history of the galaxy
has ever realized such a thing against such odds and obstacles.  What could
they do if they put that effort into something <em>constructive?</em>"</p>

<p>"Like what?"</p>

<p>"I think only the humans themselves can decide what might be important enough,"
I said.</p>

<p>We talked through the night.  Each of us had seen things that we were pretty
sure had never been seen before in the whole history of the Milky Way.  We
might not be able to save humans from themselves, we eventually agreed, but
as they attained powers we had never seen before with an obvious lack of the
impulse control we had been taught as Curators, it seemed irresponsible and 
even cruel to not at least try to help them.</p>

<p>We were done being passive spectators.</p>

<p><em>Present Day</em></p>

<p>I met Veronica at the implant institute.  "They tell me it all went well," she
said.  "So I'll gradually get younger in appearance and then live for tens of
thousands of years.  I was almost getting used to the idea of losing my groove."</p>

<p>"More like millions of years," I said.  "You no longer have the crappy B-list
implant.  This one will gradually back up your personality and when this body
does die -- you'll probably abandon it when it gets too hard to maintain -- you
will be able to take a new host of any species."</p>

<p>"I kind of like being human," she said.</p>

<p>"I've gotten used to it too."</p>

<p>"The implant is something else.  It took me a month of practice to get able to 
reliably take all my clothes with me on a fold with our implant, but this thing
just seems to <em>know</em>."</p>

<p>"We think that's linked to the personality backup functions that we don't 
understand yet.  It's tapping into brain functions that identify things we 
consider part of our personal kit without requiring us to consciously mark
them out.  It's surprising that it works so well since human clothing is 
more elaborate than anything in normal galactic experience."</p>

<p>"So tell me Andrew, why did you give it to me?"</p>

<p>"I didn't want to just leave it floating in Earth orbit for the Curators to 
recover, and you were the person in the room most likely to have a use for it."</p>

<p>"What did you do with the amplifier?"</p>

<p>"I offered that to your boss.  He decided to give it to his research director
who has the other human implant.  It could be useful to them to do a personal
interstellar fold in an emergency.  And unless you're interested in planetary
engineering it wouldn't give you any meaningful abilities you don't already
have with the Curator implant."</p>

<p>"Could that guy use it to...like the alien...?"</p>

<p>"No, I re-enabled the war locks and I changed the arming code so that even if
the Curators somehow recover it they won't ever be able to use it as a weapon
again either."</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p><em>Three Weeks Later</em></p>

<p>After we visited the DENT demonstration world I sent a handwritten invitation
-- I didn't dare commit such a thing to an electronic channel -- to Veronica's
boss.  It was his research assistant who had taken possession of the amplifier
who met me at the next arrival of the <em>Palomino</em>.</p>

<p>"I still don't feel very proficient at folding with it," he said.</p>

<p>"No matter, just let me have control and I'll guide it."  I took him to the
DENT moon and introduced him to David, Carol, and the rest of the nanite
hackers.  Knowing that we could fold they gave us a list of coordinates that
would demonstrate interesting aspects of the experiment.</p>

<p>"And this moon was completely uninhabitable when you came here?" he asked
our hosts afterward.</p>

<p>"Completely," Carol said.  "We estimate that we could apply this technique
to about a quarter of the solid worlds in the universe.  And that's without
moving them to improve their station, as we understand you can do with a 
Curator implant."</p>

<p>"A special implant called an amplifier," I said.  "We're far from making our
own but we've relieved the Curators of a couple of theirs."</p>

<p>"Really?" David said.</p>

<p>"They really don't know squat about computer security."</p>

<p>"What would you say the carrying capacity of this moon is?" my guest from
Earth asked.</p>

<p>"Well it depends on the population density.  The surface area is about four
million square kilometers and we can make just about all of it habitable.
So at a comfortable rural population density ten million, or turn the whole
thing into a city and make it a hundred million or more.  But there's really
no reason to do that because there are so many worlds waiting to be developed."</p>

<p>"We might need a thousand of them if we have to evacuate the Milky Way."</p>

<p>"They can all develop in parallel, it's just a matter of strategically dropping 
nanite seeds and prepping their software."</p>

<p>"And all this only took ten years?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it will vary somewhat depending on starting conditions.  You should also
allow for time to build lifestyle infrastructure once the surface is habitable.
We haven't bothered to do that here."</p>

<p>"We don't know how long we have."</p>

<p>"Well you're also going to have to build ships.  It's probably going to take 
longer to get everyone here to the Pinwheel than it will to terraform enough DENT 
worlds to house them."</p>

<p>We met with Jay and Emma while he was waiting for the <em>Palomino</em> to return from
the Milky Way.  "It gives us cause for hope if things go south," he told them,
"but we still haven't gone public with the danger the Curators now pose."</p>

<p>"There may be a limit to that danger as now we have the defense networks."</p>

<p>"You seem quite sure that they won't improve their tech."</p>

<p>"I'm reasonably sure they have forgotten how to innovate, but I would agree 
with Jay and Emma that we can't <em>depend</em> on that."</p>

<p>"We already watched half the human race die.  We're not going to just watch
that happen again," Emma said sternly.</p>

<p>"No, not at all.  Now that Earth's government is unified there is general agreement
that you are right about that, even among those who might have been considered
complicit in letting it happen."</p>

<p>"We are human," I said.  "We can learn."</p>

<p>"You're a Curator," the research director said.</p>

<p>"They've gotten used to thinking of themselves as Curators who have taken alien
hosts.  But I have come to consider myself a human who has the memories of a 
Curator to draw on for guidance.  And I've learned to take some of that guidance
with a large grain of salt."</p>

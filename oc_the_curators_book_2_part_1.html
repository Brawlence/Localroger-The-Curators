<p>In the morning darkness of the last day of the <em>Pax Quattuor</em>, we made love.  Partly we (or I suppose I should say <em>I</em>) worried that it might all go spectacularly wrong and it might be our last chance, and partly just because as my wife once famously told the Raiders of Kattegat, humans are always in season.  </p>

<p>I was a hundred and forty-four years old, and Emma was a hundred and forty.  Either of us would have been carded to prove our age if we tried to buy cannabis.  This was not generally the case for our peers; the people who ran the world still tended to look like old men because they had been old when we brought the anti-ageing serum, which slows but does not reverse the effects of ageing.  And most of those old men had already been running the world when we left it forty years before.  Considering how dynamic our history had once been, Earth had really changed little in that time, and that meant they were now botching it badly.</p>

<p>"So today we visit the Chinese," I said as the coffee brewed.</p>

<p>"That's the plan."</p>

<p>"How do you think they will react to our appearance?"</p>

<p>Emma poured her coffee and sat down.  "They'll try to kill us, of course."</p>

<p>She was the warrior, so this did not bother her.  That they would try to kill us didn't bother me; the Curators had given us great powers with which to pursue the Curation of our homeworld, and with her human experience and skills Emma had made those powers into things even the Curators themselves had never imagined.  The Curators preferred to do their deeds in the shadows, appearing in the corner of the room where you weren't looking, rarely leaving obvious evidence of their works.  But being humans, Emma and I knew that saving Earth would require something more theatrical.  And being human, I knew we would probably have to kill a lot of the people we were about to call on.  That bothered me.</p>

<p>But it did not bother me enough to call off the plan.  They had saved seven billion people in the galaxy's first interstellar diaspora as the Earth's climate changed, but they had also let seven billion more die of privation and outright genocide as their homelands were drowned, their livelihoods dried up, and the agricultural lands that fed them became poisoned and barren.  And with fold technology they had had the resources to save those people too if they had wanted to.</p>

<p>Emma looked at the clock.  "The Chancellor should be taking his evening tea in a few minutes," she said.</p>

<p>I joined her in casing our destination.  Our implants are able to use microfold sensing to draw a map of worlds hundreds of light-years away accurate enough to tell where one might best appear so as not to draw attention, and to target one's fold journey to that place.  It worked even better when the target was only a few thousand kilometers away.  The Chancellor was in fact on his way to the antechamber where he would join his mistress for the evening.</p>

<p>Mandarin Chinese was spoken exclusively within the government compound, but with the translation matrix loaded into our implants we could understand the language clearly in real time and speak without hesitation, with a bit of an accent but clearly understandable ourselves.  Unlike the translation machines for which the matrix was originally made, our implants were neurally interfaced and so there was no obvious interaction necessary for us to speak such an unfamiliar language.  The Curators had been doing the same thing for billions of years.</p>

<p>We donned the silver Spandex suits the Witnesses had made for us, and of course our crowns.  Then we folded to a corner of the room where the Chancellor did not happen to be looking, as the Curators usually do.</p>

<p>"If we might have a word," I said formally and politely.</p>

<p>The Chancellor jumped; he was anticipating a romantic encounter, not this sort of surprise.  "Who are you and how did you get in here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"We are the King and Queen of Earth, and we have come to take our thrones," Emma said.  She tapped her titanium crown suggestively.</p>

<p>"What is this madness!"</p>

<p>"You are one of the four leaders who have been taking our place, and making a <em>scree</em> of it."  The word which does not translate into English very well meant something like shit-show, but with particular nuances.  It's what popped out of the translation matrix with a little mental asterisk.</p>

<p>"I am the ruler of this nation, and your presence here is unacceptable.  You will leave now."  He pressed a little concealed button in the sleeve of his robe.  We knew about it and let him, since it would be better for our purposes if someone saw what was about to happen.</p>

<p>"We will leave when it suits us to do so," Emma purred.</p>

<p>A group of armed men burst into the room.  We knew they were the only guards within sixty meters, because the Chancellor liked his privacy when taking his private pleasure.  But he was also not a stupid man and he felt that a half dozen elite guards with automatic weapons could take care of any surprises that might intrude on him.</p>

<p>He was wrong.</p>

<p>We let him get clear of the path between us and the guards, since it wouldn't suit our purposes for them to kill him the way Huey Long's guards had killed their leader.  "Remove these interlopers," he ordered, and the guards advanced.</p>

<p>Emma projected a horizontally oriented gravitational field escalating to as much as half a gravity before the men could get to us.  As they pushed into this increasing resistance the leader said "We can't reach them, sir."</p>

<p>The Chancellor had not expected this, and now he ran for it.  Unfortunately he encountered another gravity field that I projected preventing his escape.</p>

<p>"Just kill them!" he finally shouted, and the men raised their arms.  They all fired, and the bullets fell onto the floor in front of us, sharply decelerated by an automatic process Emma had programmed into our implants.  The default behavior the Curators had programmed would have simply folded us to safety, but we wanted them to see and wonder about our powers.  They fired again, this time in three-round bursts, and then switching to full auto.  After what sounded like a very brief thunderstorm they ran out of ammo and the floor in front of us was littered with bullets.</p>

<p>"That was very annoying," I said.</p>

<p>The guards struggled to reload but we used a heavier gravity pulse to force them back through the door and toss them across the far room.  We could have easily killed them by keeping that field up until they hit something, but we let them decelerate safely instead.</p>

<p>"This is our homeworld," I lectured the soon to be not-Chancellor.  "We are human.  But we no longer recognize it or how our brothers and sisters are treated here.  You must commit to fix this.  We have no problem with a scarcity-based society, since it is competition for resources that drove our people to greatness.  But we do have a problem with a scarcity-based society where a few people have stolen all the wealth and are letting those around them starve because they don't want innovation."</p>

<p>"I do not care what you want," the Chancellor sputtered.  "I am the leader here.  You will leave now or I will have you killed."</p>

<p>"You already tried that," Emma said.  "How's it working out for you?"  She was advancing on him and he was retreating, until his back was literally up against the wall.  Emma reached for his face, and when her fingers touched him she looked at the door.  The guards, freed from the gravity trap, were just regrouping there.</p>

<p>"Please," their leader said, "let's just..."</p>

<p>Emma and the Chancellor disappeared.  But his clothes didn't.</p>

<p>"You're too late, boys," I said to the guards, and then I disappeared too.</p>

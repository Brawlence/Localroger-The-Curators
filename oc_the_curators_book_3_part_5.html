<p><em>Two Thousand Years Ago</em></p>

<p>If the Greeks were hindered by an excessively philosophical approach to those ideas
that might have made advanced technology possible, the Romans had the opposite problem.
They were nothing if not ruthlessly practical both in their aspirational architecture
and their engines of conquest.  But they considered math and geometry to be the tools
of the rough trade of building, whose members existed to serve the exalted whims of 
their masters.  The arts of reading and writing were too fine to be wasted on such 
ordinary people, and so their arts were handed down by apprenticeship and word of 
mouth, and thus completely lost when the empire folded up.</p>

<p>The Romans would eventually conquer everyone within range except for the Egyptians, who
had the resources of the Nile valley to draw on.  That range was limited primarily by
the time it took for their armies to reach a destination on foot, a range they extended
by building the finest roads any of us (including we human Curator agents) had ever seen.</p>

<p>Of course this also required them to practice a very casual brutality which always came
up when we pointed out what humans were doing to those who had sent us to watch them.
Human success would always be a temporary aberration, we were assured.  Such a society
could never be stable.  And the collapse of the Roman empire, after a succession of
increasingly self-absorbed and outright insane emperors, seemed to confirm this.</p>

<p>But from the ground on Earth we could see another facet of this that other Curators
refused to acknowledge.  Since we had denied humans the tools that eliminated scarcity
and granted power, those who wished to eliminate scarcity or acquire power had little
choice but to enslave their neighbors.  Their agricultural techniques were primitive
and hard on the land, and their architecture and engineering were also all dependent on
manually manipulating things that could be found on the surface of their world.  This
required much backbreaking labor which was often coerced by the threat of violence.</p>

<p>I spent as much time with the Roman engineers who were raising aqueducts and vaulted
domes as I did with their emperors.  The fact that humans had managed to raise any 
kind of civilization at all was amazing, and the fact that that civilization was 
cruel should not have been surprising.</p>

<p><em>Present Day</em></p>

<p>Jay, Emma, and several of the fold and implant researchers joined us as I brought Thomas
to a room which I had included in the plans for Terminus City on the possibility that 
something like this might eventually happen.  It was an enormous open space twenty 
meters tall and thirty meters across, with three massive support posts molded into the floor.</p>

<p>"You have to let me unlock it," I told Thomas.  "This is what it will tell you, and how
you must respond."  He followed my instructions, and soon I was in full remote control
of his implant.  I gave it the disconnect command and prepared to stop it from running
for home, but it didn't move; a few more queries revealed that it was simply out of
range to make its way where it was supposed to go on disconnection, and there was no
programmed backup course of action.  I moved its point of contact with our space-time
continuum out of Thomas' head and made it visible as a point of light.</p>

<p>"That's it?" Thomas asked.</p>

<p>Instead of responding I moved the point to the center of the room and instructed it
to unfold its protective bubble.  From our perspective it grew from a point
into a ten meter diameter mirrored sphere in a matter of moments.  The sphere 
settled gently onto the support pillars, and then I instructed it to wipe its 
memory and shut down for maintenance.</p>

<p>"Is there any danger of that happening by accident?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"None whatsoever," I replied.  "It was more difficult for me to make that happen than
you probably realize.  I had to overcome several levels of automatic safeguards in
addition to the ones Thomas could have controlled consciously.  Speaking of which,
I think we have a trade to make."</p>

<p>"It's over here," our lead implant specialist said.  There was a crate which opened
to reveal a much smaller sphere.  He instructed Thomas to grasp the sphere at two
particular points with his hands, and it shrunk to a point and disappeared.</p>

<p>"You'll become aware of it shortly," the specialist told him.  "We're very curious 
to hear what you have to tell us as that happens."</p>

<p>Thomas glanced up at the enormous Curator implant.  "Might not have been an entirely
fair trade," he said with a wink to let us know he was kidding.</p>

<p>"Mostly carbon in the outer layers, diamondoid or graphene," I said absently.  "Lots
of silicon near the center, several layers of gallium -- probably gallium arsenide,
and some other bulk semiconductors here and there.  Definite spherical shell internal
structure."</p>

<p>"We hope to learn a lot from that one," the specialist told Thomas.  "And as we 
get better, we'll need you to grade our progress as we upgrade yours."</p>

<p>One of the assistants left with Thomas to monitor his introduction to his new 
implant.</p>

<p>"Where do we even start," the senior specialist said.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't learn much from it without the aid of my amplifier, which I've made
into a very sensitive probe for this very work.  We will need at least one volunteer
to couple with it while we study what is happening inside it; that should be possible
within this room even with the implant unfolded like this.</p>

<p>"People will line up for the opportunity," he promised.</p>

<p>"We may also need to scan the volunteer's brain at the same time.  I can only do
one or the other because it requires a different microfold probe configuration.
I may need to get Sofia involved since I gave her the amplifier they sent with 
Thomas."</p>

<p>"We could have studied the amplifier too."</p>

<p>"Not really.  It would have been almost a kilometer in diameter like this,
completely impractical to deal with, and amplifiers don't have the systems
we need to learn the most about.  It's more useful to us as what it was 
made to be."</p>

<p>"Well you're the expert."</p>

<p>"I know a lot about how they work," I said, "thanks to Jay's report after his
period of emulation.  But I don't know <em>anything</em> about how they were <em>built</em>.
Neither, as far as I can find out, does anyone else alive.  I had to tease out the 
engineering override codes by using human hacking techniques starting with the minimal
access Jay's emulation awakening provided.  Fortunately the Ancestors believed in 
verbose error messages and didn't have much of a clue about computer security.  If
there are any Curators alive at all who know these things they are few in number 
and very secretive about what might be possible."</p>

<p>"Well surely they continue to build more of them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but all that's been automated since before the Earth was formed.  If we could
find the manufactory and throw a spanner into its works they would probably be as
helpless as lambs."</p>

<p>"Just tell me where it is," Jay said.</p>

<p>"That's the problem.  Even the Curators don't seem to know where it is.  There are
microfold message codes used for summoning and release but nobody has any idea <em>how</em>
those requests are honored.  Our implants may be cheap knockoffs but at least we 
know where they're made."</p>

<p><em>Later That Month</em></p>

<p>On the next circuit of the <em>Palomino</em> back to Earth, Captain Varnault brought an
urgent message for Jay and Emma.  They designated me to go to Earth and get the 
details.  The chief executive of Earth's government, who was currently Chinese,
met me at the Red Estate, which was now a government facility since the Red Prince
was living on a Pinwheel colony world.  He poured me a generous shot of fine
Australian Scotch and said, "We have received an ultimatum from the Curators."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"He folded in to the general assembly hall as we were wrapping up our summer
session.  He disabled all the communication equipment and jammed the doors and
made a short speech.  We don't have recordings because all that was disabled,
but fortunately we maintain the tradition of having a human shorthand reporter 
on hand."  He handed me a folded piece of paper.  "Everyone in the room heard
it in their own language," he said.  "The reporter was British."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We who created you have lost patience with human interference in the patterns
of growth and trade within our garden the Milky Way Galaxy.  Henceforth we
forbid you to introduce more new technologies to our other children or to
extend your influence to more Indexed worlds.  Know that we will also be 
putting those races who have already adopted certain of your technologies on
notice.  We will allow you to explore our Garden as individuals as long as
you do not change what you find, and as long as you do not do so in an official
capacity of any type.  From this point on fold ships which are capable of landing
are forbidden to visit the surface of any world which has not already made their
own.</p>

<p>Know that we possess the means to overwhelm your fold inhibitor technology.
The penalty for violating these rules will be loss of your worlds, beginning
with the Earth for your first offense.  Do not make the mistake of testing us.
Our technology is billions of years ahead of yours, and your precocial efforts
are still as the toys of children compared to the forces we can command.</p>

<p>You may create whatever you want and do whatever you want on the worlds you
already occupy; it is our fault that we led you to believe that it was permitted
to take colonies, and we cannot fault you for those actions.  But further 
expansion, either by establishing new colonies or extending new influence on
our other children, will not be tolerated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I looked up from the document.  "After delivering that speech he disappeared in
a brilliant flash of light.  Some of us took over an hour to regain our vision."</p>

<p>"Fucking show-off," I said.</p>

<p>"Well we were impressed.  I am one of only a few people outside of the agency
which monitors Curator activity on Earth who knows of your <em>special project</em>.
The Curator sounded very confident that no such thing was possible."</p>

<p>"And we want them to think that for as long as possible," I said.  "If you did
not know of that, what would the council's inclination be in response to this?"</p>

<p>"Well there will be a big political fight, which is delayed until we reconvene
for the Fall.  Some will want to challenge the Curators, but they will be a
minority.  The bigger debate will be how to conform to the terms.  It's really
impossible.  Aliens visit us and they want to trade with us for what they see."</p>

<p>"That is correct.  This is structured as a trap.  That they delivered this 
signals a major realignment in Curator politics.  They don't just want to 
stop us from influencing the others.  They want to make an example of us by
destroying us all.  This demand is structured to give them the cover of a
plausible excuse even though we think we are in compliance."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that?"</p>

<p>"They already tried to destroy the world I just came from," I said.</p>

<p>"And they failed?"</p>

<p>"I'm here.  The Curators are quite wrong about more things than anybody
in this galaxy realizes.  Act as if you do not know about
our far colony or our special project here at Earth.  Make the best faith 
effort you can to be in compliance.  We are in a good position, but now 
that the gauntlet has been thrown there are other preparations we need 
to make."</p>

<p><em>Six Months Later -- Still Promethean Uplift Project +34</em></p>

<p><em>Begin Article</em></p>

<p><em>For Immediate Release via Microfold Relay</em></p>

<p><em>Scope:</em> Earth and Human Colonies</p>

<p><em>Section:</em> Humanity, Fuck Yeah!</p>

<p><em>Origin:</em> Norma R18 Fore 3 Curator Index:829166</p>

<p><em>Title:</em> A Real-Life Robinson Crusoe Returns Home</p>

<p><em>Byline:</em> Associated Colonial Press</p>

<p>This quiet world a third of the way around the galactic Wheel from Earth became a subject of interest this year when, after seventy thousand years of stubborn rejection of Curator technology, the natives developed an independent link to the microfold network on their own.  Here with the crew of the Trinity class fold ship <em>Prospero's Books</em> we found the cause of this world's sudden technological uplift -- a world that is no longer nameless.</p>

<p>"When I realized what I had to do I started calling this place Prometheus," Q said.  He is a relatively young man with a fondness for cultural references a bit beyond his apparent years, and surprisingly fresh Earthlike attire.</p>

<p>"The Prometheans are great makers," he says.  "They have really been on the cusp of doing this for all these thousands of years.  It just took a little push.  I showed up with a couple of the keys they needed in my head, and they did the rest even quicker than we humans did.  They just don't like the lack of control you accept when using nanites, since nobody except the Curators really knows how nanites themselves work.  But when I showed up here I knew what was possible because I knew humans had done it."</p>

<p>As to how he ended up on the world he named, Q has a story that will set investigators running all over the galaxy.  "There were eight fold drives humans made that were capable of folding a planet into its star, before we figured out how to lock that out," he told us.  They were supposed to be destroyed, despite their potential value, after the legendary M and J witnessed just such an event firsthand.  But according to Q...</p>

<p>"Would you really think something as valuable as a <em>fold drive</em> would just be melted down?  And because they were being diverted illegally, the people who got them were ... not the best."</p>

<p>Q will not talk about how he was recruited or the missions he ran before becoming marooned.  "We had a lot of freedom," he said, "being basically mercenaries.  We were trashing around the galaxy doing what we were told when called and otherwise doing whatever.  One day my buddies decided to visit this obscure world which was off the quarantine list but had no commerce with the rest of the galaxy.  Next thing I know my crew has left without me.  In retrospect I realize my first mate was almost certainly banging my girl.  And in those days, I would have killed them both if I had found out."</p>

<p>"What do you mean 'in those days?'" one of our reporters asked.</p>

<p>"Twenty years on an alien world will change your perspective," he said.  "Today I hope they're happy."</p>

<p>"And now they also have your fold ship?"</p>

<p>"I suppose.  I have no idea where it is.  And I don't suppose it was ever really <em>my</em> fold ship anyway; the people who hired us probably considered its <em>theirs</em>."</p>

<p>The investigation team is wrapping up its work here, where the Prometheans have already built antigravity aircars and may be making their own fold drives within a decade or two.  When the report is complete it will be made available to the galactic community.  We still do not know the fate of Q's fold ship, or the others he suspects were illegally made with the drives that were supposed to be scrapped, and more investigations have already begun on Earth following those accusations.</p>

<p>"The Prometheans have been sending <em>ACK</em> to the microfold network for tens of thousands of years," one of our researchers reminded Q.  "Why didn't you just get them to send a message for you?"</p>

<p>"They had sabotaged the nanite transmitter they hated so much so that no more advanced communication was possible," he answered.  "My only hope was to get them to the point where they could call for help by some other means they would be willing to actually use."</p>

<p>The team has talked extensively with the Prometheans who have verified every element of Q's story in detail.  We will be leaving soon, and closing a mystery that has perplexed the galaxy.</p>

<p>"What. The. Actual. Fuck." M said after she scanned the printout.  "Is there a single truthful thing in this whole pile of horseshit?"</p>

<p>"Not really," the human-form Curator said.  "And that is by design."</p>

<p>"The design of taking credit for all of our work?"</p>

<p>"If you take credit for your work on Prometheus, the people you think are after you will know where to find you."</p>

<p>She closed her eyes.  "So do you believe they are really still after us?"</p>

<p>"Probably so.  That would mean Q is taking a large risk.  The people who once employed him know many of those statements are lies too.  But something has to explain to the galaxy how and why the Prometheans surged forward just when they did, almost in the footsteps of humans.  You do not want to be that explanation yourselves right now."</p>

<p>"I think I'm done with this," M said.  "I don't see how I can keep going forward."</p>

<p>"This would be an odd time to give up," the Curator said.</p>

<p>"And why is that?"</p>

<p>"Now that the crisis is passing, the Prometheans are very eager to show you their first spaceship."</p>

<p>"Spaceship?  How can they have a spaceship?  They don't have a drive."</p>

<p>"They don't have a fold drive, but they do have supergravity, as well as control and navigation systems you've seen.  They have built a small ship to test their ideas on space-based systems and explore their solar system.  It won't be capable of interstellar travel but should be able to reach any world in their solar system within a matter of days."</p>

<p>"What about life support?"</p>

<p>"I understand they have a fairly advanced plan for that."  But we hadn't really heard anything about work on life support systems, and he wouldn't give details when pressed.</p>

<p>We had to wait for the Earth expedition to depart Prometheus anyway, and were only mildly surprised that Q went with them.  We gave it a couple more months to blow over before returning to Prometheus ourselves.  By then there was a general galactic consensus that the Prometheans should be left alone unless they asked for more company, and human news agencies reported that the galactic Robinson Crusoe Q had decided to settle in one of the larger cities on the rustic human colony world of Pretoria.</p>

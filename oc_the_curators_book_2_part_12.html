<p><em>One Year Later</em></p>

<p>In order to make best use of their warehouse space, the Print Works had agreed to fill our order in three runs of three hundred and fifty thousand volumes.  It would have been a little more efficient for them to print all the copies of each volume at once, but then we wouldn't have been able to start shipping until we had the whole thing complete.  As it was we were loading the human giant nanite fold ship <em>Reliant</em> for its first delivery mission.  We were watching a high-speed label printer spray labels at an application robot faster than the eye could follow.  Emma set her cell phone to force flash and shot a picture of the label tape.  The one she caught read:</p>

<p>Delivery: Ship 462933:8 at stop CI:399428 
Pallet 2 of 6 stack 1 
Destination: CI:306094 ship stop 8 of 40</p>

<p>One pallet held six full volumes, each consisting of two plastic-wrapped stacks of books.  This one would be applied to the second of six pallets bound for the eighth ship built by the people of world CI:462933.  That ship's orbit would carry it to forty worlds, the eighth of which would be CI:306094, where the stack this label was applied to would be presented to whoever the planetary leadership designated to receive it.</p>

<p>The giant fold ship <em>Reliant</em> was, like most large human fold ships, named after a famous spaceship from science fiction.  Throughout most of the galaxy though it was just 1742660:204, the two hundred and fourth registered ship built by the humans of Earth.  <em>Reliant</em> could easily carry the entire print run; since it was only carrying a third, it was also carrying a sizeable rotating contingent of scientists and tourists who were taking the opportunity to see parts of the galaxy rarely visited by humans.</p>

<p>As we were contemplating the distribution system our old friend the human Curator popped up behind us.  "You know you don't have to appear behind our backs any more," I said as we shook hands.</p>

<p>"Old habits are hard to break," he said.  "I bring special news.  Is there some place quieter where we can enjoy some fine alien liquor?"</p>

<p>Although we had not gone to lengths to disguise ourselves hardly anybody we dealt with day to day on the printing and distribution had guessed that we were the Earth's Royal Couple.  We showed the Curator to an office whose door said <em>Quality Assurance</em>.</p>

<p>"There has been a bit of an argument among our people," he said as he poured a smoky dark brown liquid into the shot glasses Emma set out.  "Not everybody is happy with your promotion.  And there is a ritual which we are all expected to witness, for which there will soon be an opportunity.  Certain of our people did not want you to show up but we have finally prevailed."  Silently, he made connection to our implants and gave us a set of coordinates about sixty thousand light-years away.</p>

<p>"What sort of ritual?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll see.  It's quite dramatic and very important to us."</p>

<p>"This is sounding a bit weirdly mysterious," Emma said.</p>

<p>The Curator smiled grandly.  "You'll understand why I don't want to spoil it for you when you find out what it is.  You really should get going though.  You only have a few days to make the event."</p>

<p>Fortunately the whole printing and shipping operation was well in hand, so it wasn't unreasonable for the QA people to slip off for a little vacation.  Our destination turned out to be a small asteroid which had been shot through with tunnels and rooms to make a fairly spacious space station a few miles across.  We appeared on the bridge, and two crew members greeted us warmly.  The crew were a diverse lot of species, no two quite the same, and their leader was very dinosaurian in profile.</p>

<p>"So I see our friend found you.  Welcome to our greatest work."</p>

<p>"He didn't tell us what this was about," Emma said.</p>

<p>"No, you're supposed to see it for yourself."  He gestured toward a large window.  There was a sunlike star illuminating the scene and two worlds, one a little less than twice the diameter of the other, separated by about ten diameters of the larger of the two.  Both worlds were very young, still glowing with pools of lava from impacts and volcanoes.</p>

<p>"A double planet?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"Not yet," the leader said.</p>

<p>Emma sucked in her breath.  "You're making a moon?"</p>

<p>"Very good.  Of course after the trouble your people went to to learn your own Moon's origin, I guessed that you might figure it out.  This is the final engineered collision which will create a stabilizing moon for this new world.  Once we observe it and record how it worked out our work will be done here until the next team shows up in fifty million years or so to introduce life, and meanwhile we will go on to another star system to do it again."</p>

<p>"How often do you do this?"</p>

<p>"We've been working on this system for about twenty thousand Earth years.  We scout a lot of systems looking for the gas giants to settle into a good harmony; if they don't, fixing that is a bit beyond even our means.  If the gas giants are looking correct we get to work on the inner system, making sure those worlds are properly harmonized too.  We expect this system to expand by a factor of about two before the orbits settle out, so we're a bit closer to the star now than would be comfortable for life.  But there's always a bit of randomness in this kind of operation; we won't know exactly what this world will be like until the spectacle is over.  At this point there is nothing we can positively do to guide it any more, so we will just watch to see how it works out."</p>

<p>"How do you engineer the inner system?"</p>

<p>"With an amplifier belt we can fold-translate fairly substantial planetoids a large fraction of an astronomical unit.  We use this to move things into the orbits where we want worlds to form, and with collisions calculated to cancel out inappropriate orbital velocities."</p>

<p>"And you did this at Sol?"</p>

<p>"We did this everywhere there is complex life in this galaxy.  The earliest worlds we made this way are no longer life-bearing because their stars have run their own lifetime and expanded into red giants or gone nova.  We have done this at least twenty million times since our ancestors made the technique practical.  This station has been our tool of that art for as long as any records can indicate.  We don't know exactly how old it is but it's been at least six billion years since these tunnels were carved."</p>

<p>"The planetoids don't seem to be moving," I said.</p>

<p>"The deceptive slowness of a mighty event seen from a great distance," Emma said.</p>

<p>"Yes, they will impact at the larger world's escape velocity, about ten kilometers per second, and it will take over an hour for the collision to unfold.  The event will begin in about thirty hours."</p>

<p>He was of course using Curator units of speed and time, but our implants translated them seamlessly.</p>

<p>"Are we in any danger here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh no, it will take over a day for the fastest ejecta to reach this point, and by then we will have completed our observation protocol and left the system."</p>

<p>"So what do we do while we wait?"</p>

<p>"We have quarters in case you want to rest.  And our mutual friend left us a bottle of some liquor from your world he promised was quite good."</p>

<p>A day later the two globes were nearly touching.  Their mutual motion still wasn't obvious, but there was now a countdown being maintained.  There weren't a lot of crew members; it turns out you don't need a very large crew to do engineering of solar systems, and several of them were out in smaller flyers preparing to observe the collision from different angles for later analysis.  Our host produced the bottle which had been left for us, and it turned out to be Johnny Walker Blue Label.</p>

<p>"Well that's a suitable toast for the birth of a world," Emma declared.</p>

<p>"Excellent."</p>

<p>As the countdown moved into the single digits of seconds, our host stood and raised his glass.  Emma and I followed suit.  "We are Curators," our host said.  "Everything we do either leads up to this moment or follows from it.  This is the thing for which we exist, the thing we give to our galaxy and our children, the greatest gift we can give to life itself:  <em>A new world.</em>"</p>

<p>As if on cue -- obvously he had timed it -- the viewport was bathed in blinding white light.  The immediate contact point was not directly visible but a cloud of ejecta was being blasted from the expanding ring of contact between the two spheres, and it was both white-hot and illuminated by even brighter light from the collision point.</p>

<p>"This is indeed a fine liquor," our host declared.</p>

<p>Emma and I joined in the toast.  "You know, after a couple of hundred years I have never met a Curated race that wasn't affected in mostly similar ways by ethyl alcohol."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's a gift from those who Curated us," our host said.  "When we return to this place to seed it with life, those seeds will contain the same genetic codes which naturally evolved on our original ancestral world.  Some of those, introduced later in the process, will spur the development of nervous systems which have similar properties.  Our susceptability to other psychoactive chemicals tends to vary, but nearly all of us can appreciate the effects of alcohol, and the art of its creation by relatively primitive methods."</p>

<p>Outside the ring of debris was expanding, but not that quickly.  "In a couple of minutes the smaller world's ejection jet will appear."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"At these levels of force rock is compressible, and the shock wave moves through the world at many times the normal speed of sound.  When the shock wave reaches the far point from the impact, a jet will form.  If the collision was head-on it would be a neat linear jet, but since the smaller world is being sheared apart by design the jet will become a fan.  That compressed rock will be freed from the confinement of more material ahead of it and leap into space."</p>

<p>Sure enough, all this happened within a few minutes.  "I've seen too many science fiction movies," Emma said.  "It's too damn quiet."</p>

<p>"If you could hear it," our host said, "you would be dead."</p>

<p>"Oh I know that," Emma said.  "Seeing it for real is a real privilege."</p>

<p>Our host put down his glass.  "Actually, it is," he said.  "You can have all of our powers, you can be talented and carry out other aspects of the great work, but until you have seen this many of us would say you aren't really Curators.  We do many things other than this, and many of those things are very important, but this is the thing that is done by nobody else, and without which our galactic garden would inevitably be sterile."</p>

<p>He poured us another round and we watched the fireworks.  In a few hours a ring of material had gone into orbit while the bulk of the smaller world's mass had merged with the larger one, spinning up its rotation.  Now the ring would coalesce into a moon, and if our hosts had done their job right tidal forces would begin to lift the moon into a higher orbit while slowing the larger world's rotation in trade.</p>

<p>But we didn't wait to see that.  After a few hours the engineering station folded out to a safer distance and we went back home to see how the publishing operation was going.</p>

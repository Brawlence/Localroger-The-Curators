<p><em>Earth Calendar Year 47921 GE</em></p>

<p>I was born on a world called Va'arna a little more than one year ago.  Since Va'arna is the moon of a gas giant in distant orbit around its star, its year is much longer than that of a naturally habitable rocky planet.  In earth units I am nineteen years old, and it was almost two Earth years ago that I celebrated my first Va'arnan birthday.</p>

<p>When my mother received her reproduction permit she had no particular father in mind.  As the population of the Two Hundred Galaxies approaches ten trillion humans have been reproducing ever more slowly, and accidental pregnancy is unheard of.  While my mother was considering suitable fathers who might also have their permits a traveler arrived, and Mother naturally assumed that like everyone else in our society he would be sterile.  By the time she realized otherwise he was long gone.</p>

<p>But such occurrences are so rare that they are celebrated by my people.  Mother had been wanting to have a child anyway so she chose to see the method of my conception as a matter of fate not to be argued with.  The population of Va'arna is about a million, which is typical for DENT terraformed gas giant moons, and during my childhood there were only ever about fifty children in our entire population.</p>

<p>On the occasion of my Va'arnan birthday my mother gave me a small box wrapped in festive paper which was old enough to have become faded and brittle.  "What is this?" I asked her.</p>

<p>"I honestly don't know," she said.  "It's from your father.  A courier delivered it about an Earth year after you were born, with instructions.  This is what he asked me to do with it."</p>

<p>"You didn't open it?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.  "You don't get to be nine hundred Va'arnan years old by doing things like that," she chuckled.</p>

<p>The box contained an ancient style mechanical tumbler lock key and a handwritten note.  It said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My child,</p>

<p>I am sorry I don't know your name, but my intelligence sources do not reach quite that
far.  I hope our evening of shared wine and other pleasure has left both your mother
and you in good stead.  I am confident that you will be implanted and given the
mortality Cure as is now standard for all humans, so you can enjoy a long and 
prosperous life.  I am far older than your mother, who may seem unimaginably old to
you at this point in your life, but as it happens you are my only child.  Accordingly,
I am leaving to you the most important thing I can for a person of your age and heritage.
In order to claim it you will have to go to the Prometheus branch of the Bank of
Earth, where you will find that this key opens a safety deposit box.  You will probably
find it more convenient to arrange passage to the Milky Way with the Prometheans 
from 208 Deucalion than via Earth and Gateway, although you will find the key gives
you access through all otherwise restricted routes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"What the hell?" I said after reading it.</p>

<p>"He seduced me with stories of his travels," Mother said.  "I should have realized from those stories that he was the kind of person who never spends more than one night in any place or with any lover.  And of course it was a complete surprise that he was fertile."  She shrugged.</p>

<p>"What the hell do you think this might unlock?"</p>

<p>"From the stories he told me it could be gems, credits, documents full of secrets, or
even a treasure map.  I am sure it will not be boring."</p>

<p>"You think I should do this?"</p>

<p>"If you don't you will kick yourself for the rest of your life for <em>not</em> doing it.
And thanks to the mortality Cure that will be a long, long time."</p>

<hr />

<p>There were nearly two hundred and fifty galaxies now with enough human worlds to earn
entrance to the Council, but we had lost the habit of naming them and ours was just 
Galaxy 208.  We did like to name our worlds and we did try to keep world-names unique
within a galaxy, but there were far too many worlds scattered too far among the 
scattered galaxies to try keeping 
them unique in the Universe.  So in a technical sense I was born on 208 Va'arna.
There might be other worlds named Va'arna in other galaxies.  Those aren't my home.</p>

<p>The Prometheans asked for and were granted the right to one colony world in each
human galaxy.  Every one of those worlds is named Deucalion, so ours is 208 Deucalion.</p>

<p>Getting there was as simple as tapping my implant for the coordinates.  I had never 
actually done an interstellar fold before but it's not really any different from 
folding to the coffee shop because you're too tired to walk; it just goes a lot
further.  I didn't try to be creative and just appeared where the implant told me
the locals would prefer for me to arrive.</p>

<p>Promethean officials aren't very officious, but I recognized the officer who approached
me as their professional greeter of alien visitors.  "What brings you to Deucalion, ally
human?" she said a bit formally.</p>

<p>"I was given an inheritance which I can only claim on Prometheus, in the Milky Way," I
said, and I showed her the key.</p>

<p>"Wow," she said with almost perfect human inflection.  She closed her eyes for a second
and when she opened them she said, "that checks out.  It's a key from the Bank of Earth
on our homeworld."</p>

<p>"How did you check that out?" I asked.</p>

<p>She tapped her head.  "Model One implant.  Still can't get them on the homeworld,
but out here in the boonies nobody cares and they're freely available."</p>

<p>"Any advice for a daring traveler?"</p>

<p>"None at all, friend.  I was born here and I'll probably never see it myself."</p>

<p>Then she told me it would be nearly three months before the next shuttle cycled.</p>

<p>"We have our own dedicated shuttle, but our ships aren't as fast at intergalactic
travel as the humans."</p>

<p>"Once I board the shuttle how long will it take to get to Prometheus?"</p>

<p>"Four months," she said without hesitation.</p>

<p>"And how long does it take the human shuttles?"</p>

<p>"Eight Earth days.  But their shuttle has to wait for a docking slot at Gateway, so 
it only comes here every four years.  And the next two are usually fully booked at
any given time."</p>

<p>"My father told me I should book with you, and I guess that explains why.  My implant
could fold a small personal ship, so is there some reason I can't just fold there myself?"</p>

<p>"It's been done, but it's not easy.  Your implant doesn't have the functions to correct
for cumulative errors that occur in galaxy travel.  You'd probably be able to get to
the Milky Way, but once there you'd have no idea where you were in the galaxy and no 
easy way to sync your implant to index coordinates.  The shuttles carry special 
navigational instruments for that purpose."</p>

<p>I regarded the key in my palm.  "Well I guess that means I should find an inn," I said.</p>

<p>"You could always fold home and wait.  We can send you a microfold ping when it's 
time to return."</p>

<p>"No, that doesn't feel right.  The second step in the journey of a lifetime shouldn't
be back through my own front door.  I've never been off my homeworld before."</p>

<p>"Well there are lots of things to do and see both here and on the other human worlds
of 208.  We have suggestions which we keep up to date for our visitors from our own
homeworld.  You might find them helpful.</p>

<p>"Great!  Let's start with some place I can stay until the shuttle arrives."</p>

<p>It wasn't like diaspora was a new thing for humans; in the ancient past large
populations had abandoned entire countries that turned hostile or inhospitable,
and in the climate crisis of the twenty-second century most of the human
population abandoned Earth for its new colonies.  </p>

<p>The ships we built to bring our population to the Pinwheel were ten times larger
than anything that had ever been built, and they were capable of landing with 
their complement of thirty thousand passengers.  We built two hundred of those 
ships in order to get fifteen billion people to the Pinwheel within our promised
deadline, and we made the ships spacious and pleasant so that when the diaspora
was over they could also serve as permanent homes for a few million people who 
might like a more mobile and interior lifestyle than planets would afford.</p>

<p>We repeated our summit with the Curator representative every few years so 
that we could report on our progress, which was much less visible in the first
few years of the treaty, and to make sure that we were in satisfactory compliance
with every term we had agreed on.  There were no further fold attacks on human
worlds and the representative expressed surprised pleasure at our enthusiasm
and industry in the matter.</p>

<p>As we began to actually draw down the population of our colonies we had to
honestly report that we didn't think it would be possible to forcibly remove
everybody.  To our mild surprise the Curator expressed understanding, and
reminded us that they had no way to compel their own people to comply with
such an edict.  </p>

<p>But we had offered a handsome carrot in the form of the mortality Cure,
although it visibly bothered the Curator that we were creating such a large
population of potentially long-lived humans at the Pinwheel.  And we matched
it with a stick;  when we were ready to fully abandon a colony we would sow a 
human-specific sterility virus there.  Anyone who stayed behind could live out
their few boosted centuries, but they would not be starting up another generation.</p>

<p>The first wave of DENT worlds became not just habitable but comfortable about
twenty years into the term of the treaty, and by that time we had built fifty
new great ships, most of which had been mothballed until we had new homes for our
colonists to reach.</p>

<p><em>Twenty Years Later</em></p>

<p>Callie guided the <em>Spy Who Loved Me</em> into orbit around DENT experimental world
388.  The ship was nanite based, as nearly all Pinwheel ships were since we
had to build a lot of them in a tearing hurry, but <em>Spy</em> was a modest scout 
vessel with a crew capacity of forty.  It was her crew's job to determine 
whether DENT worlds were ready to certify for occupation by colonists, and I
was on board for a short while as an observer for our Imperial masters King
Jay and Queen Emma of Terminus.</p>

<p>"All right people, let's get the diagnostics.  It's been eight years since we
visited this place, and from the big swivel chair it's looking pretty good," 
Callie said over the ship's PA system.</p>

<p>DEX-388 was a proper planet in its own orbit but like most such worlds it had
only a tiny captured asteroid for a moon.  It had resembled Mars in some other
ways, being cold and dry and nearly airless but the nanites had fixed all that.
Now there was quite a bit of green visible from space, and while most of that
would be fast-growing mosses and lichens the ecosystem was poised to become
richer once there were more nutrients in the nanite-processed soil.</p>

<p>One by one the habitability indeces came up green, until the board was completed
by the fact that the cities were finished and ready for habitation.  "My fellow
humans, I believe we have ourselves a new world here," Callie said and there was
shipwide applause.</p>

<p>It now fell to the crew of the <em>Spy</em> to name this new world, since it was not 
human nature to keep calling it 388 until its star went nova.  This was a ritual
that would involve the entire crew of the <em>Spy</em> for several days, as we were all
required to supply at least one suggestion and then to participate in a voting
cascade which would decide on three final candidates.  Callie, as the captain,
would then pick one of those to be the name of the world.  A tradition started
by Queen Emma herself stated that a name had to be chosen before the crew of the
<em>Spy</em> began their final task, landing and on-site evaluation.</p>

<p>The naming ritual was cause for much partying and I found Callie watching over
her crew, not really participating very much in the festivities, because her
role as captain required a certain distance.</p>

<p>"Leadership seems like a lonely occupation," I said as I offered her a glass of
champaigne.</p>

<p>She accepted it and said, "I don't know, I spent an awful lot of time in the 
outback waiting for the call that Earth was under attack.  I couldn't tell 
anyone why I was there or what I was capable of doing."</p>

<p>"Or that you had one of the most valuable objects in the galaxy hidden away in
one of your parts drawers."</p>

<p>"In the <em>sex toys</em> drawer," she corrected with a sharp laugh.</p>

<p>"And now your suction truck is on a pedestal outside of the royal palace, and
your Ben-Wa balls are in an exhibit case where millions of people will see
them."</p>

<p>"Yeah."  She took a sip of her drink.</p>

<p>"You seem sad," I observed.</p>

<p>"Not really.  It's just... you've lived a long time, how do you deal with the
idea that maybe you've done the best and most important thing you'll ever do,
and all you will ever do forever more is skate on the memory of something you
did when you were thirty years old?"</p>

<p>"That is <em>so</em> human.  Callie, famous accomplishment isn't a thing you work toward,
it is a thing you stumble upon.  Just because you never do something like saving 
the world doesn't mean you're less of a person than the person who did.  It just
means you were in the right place and time to have the chance.  When it happened
you acted with determination and valor and that was necessary and critical to 
the situation, but there were other humans who would have stepped up if they
were asked, just as there were others who would have failed.  You do your best 
in those situations you encounter and don't think about being remembered for it.
Most of what you do in a long life won't be remembered.  Even <em>you</em> won't remember
most of it."</p>

<p>"I suppose there aren't any statues of you out there," she said.</p>

<p>"Not exactly."  But then I told her the original story of Joseph, whose coat 
of many colors had been an embelleshment but whose advice to an ancient king 
had been very real.</p>

<p>Callie laughed.  "Well I guess I'm not in the <em>Bible</em>," she said.  "I just think
of all those years stacked ahead of me thanks to the Cure, and I can't imagine
what it will be like to live through all of them.  Once in awhile when I'm talking
to Jay or Emma they will get quiet and I'll remember what they've been through.
They're only a couple of hundred years old and I can't imagine what it's like to
be <em>them</em>.  I must seem like a child to you."</p>

<p>"All living humans are like children to me," I said.  "But there is no shame in
that, because you are precocious and brave and unwilling to take no for an
answer, and you've done things that much older beings and even civilizations 
have considered impossible.  I have a million years of personal life experience
and I'm considered kind of youthful by <em>my own</em> people.  But who among us would
build a starship out of a sewerage scow and pilot it to another <em>galaxy</em>?  We
all know what a bad idea that is and would refuse to do it."</p>

<p>"The agent was unthrilled too.  She promised me that if we died alone in 
intergalactic space she would make sure I died <em>first</em>."</p>

<p>At that I laughed.  "She got in your ship knowing that was a possibility but
also knowing that people she trusted and had sworn to serve said you were 
capable of pulling it off.  Veronica doesn't show her fear.  For her to do
so would often be suicide."</p>

<p>"She allowed me to see her fear," Callie said and this time with a little
smile.  "She made quite sure I knew what it felt like myself."</p>

<p>Eventually the festivities roared to a crescendo and after the ballots were
winnowed her chief engineer presented her with the three final ballots.  This
would normally have been done by her first mate, but she was passed out in her
cabin in bed with the ship's biotech consultant.</p>

<p>"Well we are <em>not</em> doing <em>this</em>," she said and she handed me the first ballot,
which was marked <strong>FRODO</strong>.</p>

<p>She unrolled the second ballot.  "This is marginally more acceptable, but 
only <em>marginally</em>.  She handed it to me and I saw that it read <strong>YARBLE</strong>.</p>

<p>"Well it <em>is</em> a ball," I said.</p>

<p>She unrolled the third ballot.  "Comedians.  They're all fucking comedians."
She handed me the third ballot and said, "Well Andrew, welcome to the new
human world <em>Yarble,</em> whose future residents will probably have quite a lore
about why their world is named after a testicle."</p>

<p>I unrolled the third ballot and saw that it read <strong>SCOOBY DOO</strong>.</p>

<p>"I think you chose wisely," I said with a slight grin.</p>

<p>"Is there anybody on this brick awake and sober enough to push the button 
that tells it to land at the spaceport, or do I need to do it myself?"</p>

<p>"I think I can manage," the chief engineer said as he shook his head and
chuckled.</p>

<p>When we were alone again Callie turned to me and said, "What must this look
like to you?"  She gestured at the ballots.</p>

<p>"It looks like your people know how to have fun," I said.  "And that's
something I'm trying hard to learn for the first time myself.  It's not
as easy as you might think.  You shouldn't try so hard to lose it.  There
may be a statue of you and your project may be mounted on a pedestal but 
don't tell me it wasn't also <em>fun</em> to build a spaceship out of garbage 
and spare parts which only you knew could not just fly, but fly <em>here</em>."</p>

<p>She nodded.  "It was fun."</p>

<p>"So that's your answer to what to do with all those years you now have to
live through.  Have fun, and the other things will take care of themselves."</p>

<p>It sounded like a simple enough problem:  Look for technological artifacts of the Ancestors on the moons of the gas giants.  There were just a couple of bigger problems.</p>

<p>First we were looking for things that would have been sitting there for literally billions of years.  There was no telling how deeply buried or badly damaged something might be that had been left sitting on the surface of a moon for deep geological time.</p>

<p>On the plus side the worlds we were targeting were cold and their surfaces were in vacuum.  We decided to skip the worlds a with thick hydrocarbon atmoshere, the one with tidally driven volcanoes, and the two with obvious tidally warmed oceans under thick crusts of ice.  On the minus side those were the worlds we'd have gone to first and found most interesting, and anything we did find anywhere would have been exposed to aeons of radiation and micrometeorites and one nearby non-super nova.  </p>

<p>And second, these were <em>worlds</em>.  They might seem small compared to the Earth but they still had millions of square kilometers of surface area.  Combine that with the fact that we didn't really know what we were looking for, and it was a daunting challenge.</p>

<p>After a couple of weeks the lead engineer demonstrated a prototype surface explorer for us.  It resembled a large spider with a body about thirty centimeters across and six legs spanning a three meter circle.</p>

<p>"The legs aren't articulated," the engineer said.  "It hovers via microfold supergravity, like an aircar.  It's powered by the microfold from the core of the nearest gas giant.  Most of the body is made of nanites for rapid development but the microfold engine and core detector array are bulk nanoassembled with our fast error correcting methods.  It carries a gravitometer, magnetometer, and nuclear particle detector, and by clever use of the microfold it can generate the excitation energy for magnetic resonance, X-ray diffraction, and neutron activation.  Also of course a camera and seismometer, although we don't expect to need those very much."</p>

<p>"What are you looking for?"</p>

<p>"Anything that doesn't ring geological.  Concentrations of mass or magnetism.  Indications of elemental metal or semiconductors.  Unusual crystals.  Evidence of light particles in rocky matrix, possibly remnants of plastics.  And of course anything that doesn't look like a rock sitting on the surface."</p>

<p>"How fast can it scan?"</p>

<p>"Not very fast.  Some of the detectors take awhile to register what we're looking for and don't have much range, so it will travel on average a few centimeters per second, and we want to cover the whole surface to a resolution of at worst a couple of meters."</p>

<p>"We're going to make thirty-five thousand of them and it will take them fifteen or twenty years to complete the survey.  Most of us will go home once the survey is underway, but we'll need you to keep our secret and be available to return for the next phase.  We would really prefer for you to go to the Pinwheel while waiting this out.  There are too many goddamned Curators on Earth and we don't want them to get wind of what we're up to."</p>

<p>For that same reason we didn't want to dump all of our people off at Gateway at the same time so Red's ship made dozens of round trips between Earth and the neutron star, dropping off a few people each time and returning to deploy the rovers that had been completed en route.  We didn't hurry, taking plenty of time between folds and scheduling our returns to make it look like we were doing an orbit of the Five Galaxies.  This was considered a relatively normal thing by modern standards.</p>

<p>We built an automated data center on one of the moons of the middle gas giant after the prototype rover cleared the proposed construction area of possibly interesting signals.  The data center routed the rovers, recorded their results, and changed their assignments according to geological issues or the occasional interesting detection signal.  We made no immediate effort to pursue the possible positives that the rovers recorded; the engineers and archaeologists were still debating how to approach the next phase of examining those places where the rovers had found something worth investigating more closely.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Twenty Years Later</em></p>

<p>We all passed by the countdown clock at Gateway on the way back to the Ancestors' system, and it was down to just ten years.  When it was first installed it had just been a plain display, but now it was surrounded by festive decorations and posters and there were other commemorative displays scattered around the station.</p>

<p>Back at the neutron star the data center had logged over five thousand signals of interest, some of them just barely out of the noise band from what might naturally occur and some so startling they <em>must</em> have been the remains of machines.  We decided to start with the midrange signals that had more than minimal promise as we developed techniques for doing archaeology in the harsh environment.  We had gotten rather used to just making our work areas habitable with DENT technology back home, but that wouldn't suit this project at all.</p>

<p>Eventually we optimized a design for a manned exploration rover that was like a scaled-up version of the original robot probes with a pressurized operator's capsule and much more sophisticated scanning and digging tools.  We ended up building five of them.  The prototype cleared sixty signal targets in the first month, about half of which were false positives and the rest of which were definite artifacts.  Most of those had been shattered or at least partially melted.  But some of them showed clear signs of being nanoassembled, which is not a thing that ever happens naturally and was exactly what we were looking for.</p>

<p>Other than learning that there had been a civilization here that could do nanoassembly we didn't learn much else from those fragments though, and we decided to work our way towards the signals of better promise as our skill increased at extracting and handling them.  Within a year we discovered what had to be the foundation of an inflatable habitat surrounded by smaller debris.  We found fragments that had clearly been parts of recognizable displays and sensors.</p>

<p>We discovered the badly decayed remnants of several wheeled rovers.  Some of these had engraved markings which were eerily remniscent of written Galactic Common.</p>

<p>We came to realize that there had been several waves of exploration.  There were very primitive landers and rovers, there had been a handful of sites suitable for bioform occupation, and occasionally we found an artifact of more advanced technology.</p>

<p>The Ancestors seemed to have had an interest in geological prospecting, which made sense but also unfortunately left a lot of their artifacts in unstable and exposed areas.</p>

<p>But about a year before the third millennium celebration we discovered our prize.  On one of the more remote and unpromising worlds a walking rover had been covered by a rain of powdered ejecta from a nearby meteor strike.  It had been shielded from radiation, micrometeorites, and the red giant phase and final nova of its home star and its reflective surfaces were still shiny.  It was about the size of an aircar but clearly couldn't fly, and from its posture it appeared to have shut down peacefully at the end of its mission.  Its body was rectangular with rounded edges and there was a cylindrical can mounted on a spar about a meter beyond one end.</p>

<p>We brought it into a vacuum chamber, and after demonstrating that it seemed to have little tendency to react unpleasantly to normal air, we brought it inside the fold ship.</p>

<hr />

<p>"The legs are articulated in three segments each with a total of twelve degrees of freedom," the lead researcher said as he showed us scans of the rover artifact.  "The actuators are nanoassembled piezoelectric ratchet mechanisms that would have been slow but very energy efficient.  Unlike most of our other finds nearly this entire mechanism was nanoassembled.  It appears to be one of the most advanced designs we've come across, even counting the fragments and habitats."</p>

<p>The next slides were a series of internal microfold scans.  "The body is a monolithically nanoassembled block of computronium with embedded sensors.  No fold technology, so there are semiconductor light sources and sensors and passive sensors for other various forms of radiation.  Some of these may be able to telescope or hinge out from the body, particlarly underneath.  The legs double as robot arms with multi-segment retractable fingers and other accessories built into each foot."</p>

<p>Next slide.  "The can was once a nuclear reactor, although the fuel has long ago fully decayed.  The whole thing appears to have shut off peacefully before it was buried in dust.  There is no evidence of any physical damage and frankly no reason to suspect hidden damage.  It's pristine."</p>

<p>"Is there any chance the computer still contains contemporary information?" Red asked.</p>

<p>"It's nanoassembled.  Who's ever bothered to nanoassemble a computer that doesn't have nonvolatile memory?"</p>

<p>"Nobody," Red said.  "How do we query it?"</p>

<p>"You could try about thirty volts on the power rails from the reactor core.  That seems to be the power converter's design target."</p>

<p>"You have to be kidding me," I said.  "You think this thing might still work after billions of years?"</p>

<p>"It's nanoassembled," the researcher said.  "No capacitors or batteries to dry out or leak.  No solder joints to grow whiskers.  You're showing your age, sir."</p>

<p>"Well in my age we had the fold.  A lot longer ago than you realize."</p>

<p>"We all know you're a Curator, sir.  You might want to consider your own implant.  This thing shows a very high degree of skill at nanoassembly, equal to and probably better than our own as humans at this point.  The consensus among our team is that this may have been the peak of their expertise before they finally started using the fold and stopped doing this kind of exploration."</p>

<p>"Well what do you think it could tell us?"</p>

<p>"There are two ways to find out," the researcher said.  "And the other involves cutting it up destructively."</p>

<p>Nearly all of us on the expedition were present for the powering up experiment.  We had to use the largest auditorium space in the old fold ship to accommodate everyone who wanted to watch.  The researchers used a lapidary saw to cut off the nuclear reactor at the end of its arm; it would never function again anyway.  Then they bonded wires with conductive glue to the main power rails.</p>

<p>Then they raised the voltage.  At ten volts it started taking current, but erratically.  "Appears to be failing low-voltage," one of the crew said.  "At least that's how we would design it."  They raised the voltage to twenty-eight volts and the current draw stabilized.</p>

<p>"Radio signals," someone said from off to the side.  All sorts of detectors had been aimed at the rover.  "Twenty gigahertz, antenna must be embedded."</p>

<p>"It's a phased array," someone else said.  "Very highly directional even without a dish."</p>

<p>"It's scanning.  Using the phased array to sweep the area."</p>

<p>"It's a radar scan.  Sensing its surroundings."</p>

<p>"Any modulation?"</p>

<p>Someone punched a control and the auditorium filled with clicks.  "Sounds like a geiger counter," the operator said.</p>

<p>Someone in the audience stood up.  "That's Common!" he shouted.  "Clacky dialect for carrier presence modulation!"</p>

<p>The head researcher faced this young man.  "Can you tell what it's saying?"</p>

<p>"It's like a weird dialect compared to what I learned, but yeah, if...and that..."  He closed his eyes and listened for a few moments.  Then he said, "It's repeating over and over, 'Why have I been awakened?'"</p>

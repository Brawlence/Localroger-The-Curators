<p>We met Quentin on Mars.  The Earth-Luna system is swarmed with fold sensors, and so are the gas giant planets which aliens who lack our technology are likely to use for velocity adjustements.  But now that we know there are so many habitable worlds in the galaxy and most of its geology has been worked out, Mars doesn't get that much interest.  We figured Quentin would have at least twenty minutes before the scanners would positively figure out where he was.</p>

<p>The PM was as comfortable as if he had lived his entire life naked.  "There is so much we don't know about these cultures," he said.  "If humans had any idea, we'd probably do things much differently."</p>

<p>"That's one of the reasons we sent you there," Emma said.  "But soon we might need you, and we want to be sure you're the first of our exiles to return."</p>

<p>"So how do you arrange that?"</p>

<p>We nodded at Quentin, who folded us into the vicinity of Earth, just below GEO so we wouldn't get whacked by a communication satellite.  Emma took the PM's hand, and moments later we were in the lair under our house at Terlingua.  Moments after that, well before Earth's sensors could properly fix him, Quentin folded off to the other side of the galaxy, well beyond the point where their sensors could properly follow.</p>

<p>"An underground lair," the PM said.  "I suppose I should have seen that coming."</p>

<p>"But not a prison," I said.  "Right now the Earth is a hornet's nest we have stirred, and it's important that you appear at exactly the right moment."</p>

<p>"And how do you determine that moment?"</p>

<p>"Well we don't, really.  Right now it's kind of up to the Chinese."</p>

<p>The Russians had folded up the same way the Japanese had, basically also being a criminal gang with no loyalty to anything other than personal interest, as soon as they realized we were seriously going to keep disappearing anyone who seemed to be running the place.  The Chinese were different.  They were actually patriotic and had a long history of making their stand against the rest of the world.  The fifth of their leaders that we abducted bowed and warned that they would stand strong unless we genocidaly eliminated all of their ruling families.</p>

<p>"Well, that's an interesting suggestion," Emma replied.</p>

<p>Instead of sending him to a fold ship we asked him to tell us who we needed to persuade, and because he didn't want to disappear he answered all of our questions candidly.  As a result instead of folding him to a fold ship we folded him into their legislative chamber as they were preparing to select his replacement.</p>

<p>Guards fired weapons at us; that went about as usual.</p>

<p>The acting Chancellor signaled for them to stand down, and to our slight surprise they did.  "All of our leaders are safe," he said when he had been supplied with a microphone.  "They may or may not come back.  They have been sent out into the galaxy.  They all have the means to return if they learn how and try."</p>

<p>A great ruckus went up and another guard shot at us.  This time Emma tossed him across the room hard enough to probably break a couple of ribs.  She was really starting to lose patience with our own species.</p>

<p>The Chancellor signaled for us to speak.  As usual in modern Chinese government the language was Mandarin, but we still had the translation matrix loaded into our implants.  "The idea of sovereign nations fielding militaries against one another must end," I said.  "No other world in the galaxy does that.  No other species does that.  And it reinforces the idea which the Curators developed about us that we may not deserve to be a galactic species."</p>

<p>There was much shouting, but it was gaveled down and the leader of the lege said, "We have been a sovereign nation for more than three thousand years.  We will not stand down."</p>

<p>"You haven't actually been a single entity for all that long," Emma said.  "You've splintered and reformed several times, with radically different philosophies.  This time you must reform into a state of the united Earth, part of one government for all the people of this world.  A government which will not let seven billion people ever die again of privation."</p>

<p>That provoked a moment of shocked silence.  Then the leader said, "There will never be seven billion people on the Earth again.  We have learned that lesson."</p>

<p>"Even seven people is too many if they can be saved, and you let them die," Emma said sharply.</p>

<p>"Your leadership was complicit in this," I added.  "We can forgive much.  We are human and grew up here and we understand our own limitations.  But this is not a thing that can ever be allowed to happen again.  We can and will kill you all if it seems you are going back down that path."</p>

<p>"How many people have you killed so far as you try to remake our world?"</p>

<p>"Actually zero," Emma said coyly.  "I would have been a bit more definite on a couple of occasions, but your King has held me back.  So far."</p>

<p>"This body has the power to do what you ask," the leader said.  "We can dissolve the powers of the High Family, and we can disband ourselves.  To do this properly will take time for negotiation.  And it would be helpful if we had some idea what will follow."</p>

<p>"Talk to the Australians.  We will leave you alone for one week.  Then we'll be back," I said, and Emma and I disappeared.</p>

<p>"That was pretty awesome," the Australian PM said.  The human form Curator gave us slow applause.  They had been watching us through the usual microfold surveillance methods, the Curator forwarding the video feed to our TV set for the PM.</p>

<p>"Let's wait until we see what they do," I said.</p>

<p>"They will capitulate," the Curator said.  "How about some fine Indonesian sparkling wine?"</p>

<p>"Dare we ask how you know that?"</p>

<p>"Our spies have fewer targets now and so we have been concentrating on the Chinese.  We can tell you how the floor vote will go with an error of at most five, and the margin will be at least thirty."</p>

<p>A month later the Australian PM addressed the new ruling council of Earth, including its new Chinese representatives.  "We think of things on Earth as being old," he said.  "We think of some of our cultures as being ancient.  But I stand before you, having slept in a modest lodge that was built over a million years ago.  Out there, the aliens take such timescales for granted even though as individuals most of them live about as long as we do.  As a species we are not even children in this galaxy."</p>

<p>"We have done great things and I know we will do more great things, but we also have to understand that we are one species in a galaxy that is full of life, and that we must make our place here together.  We must, not as Australians or Americans or Japanese or Indians or Chinese, but as humans, choose to do things not because they are easy but because they are hard.  We must do these things together and not as squabbling nations.  Because there is a galaxy out there of over a million inhabited worlds, and at least a few of them will be likely to ask themselves how they can best us.  And we must make sure that none of them ever do."</p>

<p>As applause thundered, the Curator said "Really?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, pretty much," Emma said.  "Sounded better in the original JFK."</p>

<p>"For forty years I've been told that humans have the best fold technology in the galaxy," he continued.  "And that there was no need for us to innovate, and that innovation was bad because it might upset the balance of powers that prevailed here on Earth."</p>

<p>"But none of that has ever been true.  We only have the <em>second</em> best fold technology in the galaxy.  I've been told a race called the Prometheans has the third best, just behind us in performance and much easier than ours to build in small quantities.  But the best fold tech in the galaxy is that of the Curators.  The Curators created the inferior nanite-based drives which most worlds use for fold transportation, but that is not the tech the Curators created for <em>themselves</em>.  I have seen it at work.  I have seen an individual being fold himself across the galaxy from the surface of one world to another without using a ship.  Without obvious velocity translation.  Without rippling the air.  They can do this almost undetectably.  And every one of them carries an implant which allows them to do it at will <em>just by thinking</em>."</p>

<p>There was an audible gasp from the audience.  The public knew that their leaders had been systematically abducted until the next in line got the memo, but only a few knew just <em>how</em> that had been done.</p>

<p>"Far from having a commanding position, we have much work to do.  We know the key to the Curators' tech starts with nanoassembly; not the joining of prepared nanites but the creation of larger machines from scratch in the manner that the <em>first</em> nanites were created.  This must be our next goal, and on this day humanity will take the next step as we break ground on a center for the study of nanoassembly tech right here in Melbourne.  We will attract the best and the brightest, hopefully from our colonial exiles as well as from all regions of the Earth itself.  We face a long road since the Curators have had billions of years to perfect their craft, but it is not in our nature to stand comfortably at second place."</p>

<p>At that point the place went up with applause again and I thought the Curator was going to facepalm.  "Does he even have any idea what he's <em>saying</em>? he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh most definitely," Emma said.  "This is how you herd humans."</p>

<p>"No wonder we didn't curate you," he said.</p>

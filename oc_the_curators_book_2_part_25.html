<p><em>Three Months Later</em></p>

<p>We returned to the Nostromo after a longer than usual absence, although everyone just assumed it was another one of our jaunts with the Curators.  It had actually been anything but.  The Curators that were our friends were carefully trying to figure out why the ones who weren't had tried to assassinate us, and how deep that plot went within their ranks.  Meanwhile we kept the lowest profile possible by recruiting Quentin to accompany us with the <em>Improbable Alibi</em> on a little expedition outside of the Milky Way.  It gave us an opportunity to carefully think about what we were going to do next.</p>

<p>On our return, Emma and I went straight to the fab shop where she asked the materials manager if they had any big ball bearings.</p>

<p>"How big?"  she asked.</p>

<p>Emma held her thumb and forefinger about six centimeters apart.</p>

<p>"We got that," the manager said.  She led us to a large set of sliding drawers stuffed with metal spheres.  "All accurate to a thousandth of a millimeter, although I don't get the sense you care about that."</p>

<p>Emma picked up two of them, tested them for heft, and nodded.  "These will do."</p>

<p>Next we went to the leaderboard room and found Zeke.  "I want to set up a hunt," she said to him.</p>

<p>"You?  A hunt?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  That one."  And she pointed to the leaderboard for the largest and most ferocious predator on the world, affectionately known as murdersaurus to the team members.</p>

<p>"Well, I got that one first," Zeke said.</p>

<p>"Tell me something," Emma said, pulling one of the ball bearings from her pocket.  "If I throw one of these, does that count as bare-handed or is it passive?"</p>

<p>"If you throw it without an aid like an atlatl it's still bare-handed, just as if you picked up a rock.  But you can't kill a ten meter tall killing machine with a hand thrown ball bearing."</p>

<p>"Oh, you have no idea," she said.  "Set it up."</p>

<p>Zeke looked at me, and I just nodded.  After Emma walked off, Zeke said "Well it's her funeral, if we can find any body parts to bury."</p>

<p>"Just prepare to be surprised," I said.  "And be ready to barbecue."</p>

<p>We had considered many ways to let the team know that we wanted them to switch their focus.  It was Emma who decided we should do something really dramatic to get everyone's attention.  And since she was the warrior between the two of us, I agreed to her plan.</p>

<p>Zeke was not the sort of person to express uncertainty about anything, but he was visibly shaken by the situation as we prepared for the hunt.  "We're about three klicks from your target," he said.  "You sure you don't want to take along a plan B?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am," Emma said.  She showed the two ball bearings, one in each hand.  "I'm bringing two.  If the first one doesn't do the job I'll have a spare."</p>

<p>Zeke looked at me again, and when I grinned he just shook his head.  We were after all still his King and Queen, even if those were almost entirely ceremonial titles.  But then, as they readied the down shuttle Emma started to disrobe, and he nearly lost it.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Making sure nobody accuses me of cheating," she said as she pulled down her pants.</p>

<p>"Are you going to face off against a fifty ton killing machine <em>naked</em>?"</p>

<p>"Almost everyone in this galaxy does everything naked, except for members of one certain species with a massive body image hangup.  And do you really think a layer of cloth would make a difference if I didn't have a plan?"</p>

<p>So she set foot naked onto the soil of Terra Nova, one kilogram steel bearing in each hand, and boldly approached the predator.  It noticed her and tilted its head in that "are you crazy" gesture all parrot owners would recognize.  Emma put her hands together and bowed her head.</p>

<p>"What the fuck is she doing?" Zeke said.</p>

<p>"She is apologizing to the animal for what she is about to do," I said.</p>

<p>"She's about to get swallowed whole!"</p>

<p>"She is in no danger whatsoever.  Just watch."</p>

<p>The animal watched her wind up for the pitch, obvously not understanding why this tiny morsel wasn't running for its life, and then she threw.  By the time the ball bearing reached the animal it was traveling fifty kilometers per second, and after traversing the animal's body and piercing its heart without slowing down much it went on to orbit Terra Nova's sun.</p>

<p>The animal reacted as if it had just felt a sting, and there was a moment when it looked like Emma might have to user her second ball bearing.  But then it collapsed, and when its breathing ceased a few moments later Emma casually tossed the second bearing over her shoulder and approached the carcass.  She climbed atop the head, placed one foot on the massive beak, and waited for the photo drone to show up.</p>

<p>When we got back to the leaderboard Emma had been added but her entry for first bare-handed kill had an asterisk:  <em>Hunter used a cybernetic implant which is allowed because it fit entirely within her body and did not alter her external appearance.</em></p>

<p>After that, of course, everyone wanted to know how the hell she did it.</p>

<p>Emma was making her pitch to the engineers who would have to follow our directions to create nanoassemblers on a scale only the Curators themselves had ever achieved.  I addressed the biology team, which had come to assess the biosphere of a doomed planet and who now needed to use their tools to recreate the mortality cure.</p>

<p>I had covered a ten meter long whiteboard with symbols as my audience assembled.  "I'm not here to tell you how to kill a murdersaurus with a ball bearing," I said and there was weak laughter.  "Emma is going over that with the mech guys.  I'm here to talk about immortality."</p>

<p>After that you could hear a pin drop.</p>

<p>"You have all gotten the gift we call the boost, which slows ageing but does not reverse it.  The oldest living human is two hundred and five years old as I speak, and she is ... rather decrepit.  Meanwhile Emma and I are around a hundred and seventy years old, and you can see what we look like.  Who wants our version?"</p>

<p>There was a lot of nodding but one person said, "there aren't enough of us to do the kind of research that would take in even a boosted lifetime."</p>

<p>"That would be true," I answered, "except that there is no <em>research</em> involved.  We can tell you every step that needs to be taken.  You won't be stepping blindly.  <em>We have full understanding of the technology.</em>  We don't have the means to implement it ourselves but with our guidance you do."</p>

<p>"And what do we get for helping you?" the bio lab head asked.</p>

<p>"You get an expected lifespan of fifty to a hundred thousand years," I said, "in a state of youthful health, strength, and appearance.  And that gives you plenty of time to cross the i's and dot the t's to extend it even further, possibly to as long as a million years.  That is the basic purpose of the longevity cure.  It is based partly on genetic modifications and partly on bionanites, which we would need our colleagues on the other symposium to help a bit with, to clean up the things our genetic mechanisms can't manage on their own."</p>

<p>"What about Terra Nova?" another voice asked.</p>

<p>"It has become clear to us that this project was folly, and that we cannot avert the Curators' plans for this world.  Having assembled this team though, we think we can put you to better use than murdering animals that our Curator friends are going to murder anyway."</p>

<p>"What will the Curators think of this?" another called.</p>

<p>"That is the big question, and we have an answer for you.  But it's a topic we need to take up with all of you, not just the experts in one field or another.  Emma should be wrapping up her presentation to the tech guys and then we would like to address all of you at once to let you know our ultimate plan."</p>

<p>"How'd it go?" Emma asked when we met during the intermission.</p>

<p>"About like you'd expect when you offer someone the Fountain of Youth.  And yours?"</p>

<p>"About like you'd expect when you offer someone the chance to become Superman."</p>

<p>As we walked out together to address the whole crew we were greeted with applause.  Since Emma had kicked it off by wielding the ball bearings she kicked off our final presentation.</p>

<p>"Some of you have probably been catching each other up on our two symposia.  And all of you are probably seriously wondering whether what we've told you is really possible, and whether you should seriously consider giving up your previous goals to follow ours.  That is what this meeting is about."</p>

<p>"There is a political battle brewing among the Curators as we speak," I said.  "This is extremely dangerous, because the Curators aren't accustomed to having such conflicts.  We cannot tell which side will prevail, or if either side <em>can</em> prevail.  We know that even individual Curators are insanely powerful beings, and that if even a small group of them set about our extermination, at our current level of technological skill they will probably succeed."</p>

<p>The whole audience let out a collective gasp.</p>

<p>"To some Curators we are the ultimate expression of the intent of their Ancestors who created the garden of the Milky Way something like seven billion years ago.  They reason that the Ancestors must have been much like humans, since they weren't Curated themselves and they created all of this.  But the Ancestors themselves are no more, because their sun burned up their homeworld as it aged into a red giant and the Ancestors did not attempt a diaspora such as we have made."</p>

<p>"And to the other Curators," Emma continued, "we are a virulent disease infecting their garden and ruining a stability they have guarded for aeons.  They detest our innovation and even more they detest our tendency to share what we have made with others.  If these Curators ever become ascendant we do not believe they will tolerate Earth as it is currently run.  They might tolerate the colonies which have less aggressive economies, but then again we know that they once folded dozens of worlds into their suns to stop what they saw as another disease infecting their garden."</p>

<p>"Fuck them, it's our world!" someone shouted, and there was a chorus of "Yeah."</p>

<p>"But that's not what the Curators think," I said.  "This is their garden full of worlds that they made, one of which happens to be the Earth.  And there is an observation I made a long time ago, when the Sevillian native I called K told me about the Mark of the Curators.  To a certain extent the Curators must believe they own all of the things that have grown in their garden."</p>

<p>"Well we're not marked, they must not think they own us!"</p>

<p>"That is exactly true," Emma said.  "Just as you don't own the fox that is eating your chickens.  Those are vermin and you exclude or kill them, and you probably feel no guilt about doing so."</p>

<p>"Then it's war," another voice called.</p>

<p>"And as things stand it will be a very <em>short</em> war which will end in our annihilation.  We have a very practical reason for offering to help you recreate these technologies for human use.  If we don't do this now, we may not have a second chance."</p>

<p>"What are the odds?  What are our chances if we do nothing?"</p>

<p>Emma looked at me.  "If we do nothing, the odds are unknowable," I said.  "At least one Curator is a dear friend, and others have worked with us and helped us to learn their ways.  But another just tried to kill the two of us, and nearly succeeded."  There was another collective gasp.  "They may finally decide to leave humans alone, they may decide to neuter Earth's governance and insist that we stop innovating, or they may wipe us out as a precautionary measure.  We can only be certain that <em>one</em> of those things will eventually happen."</p>

<p>I bowed my head.  "And I have to be honest about another thing.  If we launch this project and they realize what we're up to before we succeed, they will almost certainly do everything in their power to stop us.  They have never known an enemy who met them at technological parity.  They only tolerate the Witnesses, who have the longevity cure, because they prostrate themselves by offering the Curators free passage through their fold inhibitor.  Some time ago our Curator friend mentioned to us that if we had set up an inhibitor instead of the span limiter that now protects Earth, they would have destroyed it.  They do not like for others to have power over them and they will go to great lengths to prevent that."</p>

<p>The Red Prince stood up and everyone looked at him.  It was after all technically his mission.  "And how do we keep it secret?  We all know that if your conspiracy involves three people that's two too many."</p>

<p>"We do it all here at Terra Nova.  The Curators are all in agreement that none of them should come here until we succeed or admit failure at the folly project of wiping out the giants.  So we continue to host tourists and hold hunts, but in the labs we will not be working on better killing methods.  We sneak in more resources as we need them, with little risk since only we will be watching."</p>

<p>"How do we know they will continue this quarantine?"</p>

<p>"Motivation.  The ones who want us to succeed would not want to contaminate our success with the suggestion that they helped, and those that want us to fail would not want to contaminate their opportunity to gloat with the suggestion that they sabotaged us.  These are ancient beings and they can all be both very smug and <em>very</em> patient.  This is a chance to use that against them."</p>

<p>"So let me put it like this," Red said.  "We're about to be kicked out of the casino, and that casino is our homeworld and our galaxy.  But we got one more roll at the table.  We can walk off, hope for the best, or we can go all-in.  We fuck it up, or we just get unlucky, and we're done.  Not just us here but the whole human race.  At best we become what, pets of the Curators like all those species who bear their mark?"</p>

<p>"I think that would be the best-case scenario," Emma said softly.  "Whether we do nothing or go all-in and lose."</p>

<p>"But we get a point and make it, and we win the house.  Free trips to the show, a tab at the bar, the Elvis guy takes our requests, and oh yeah we get to live forever and play Superman.  That about right?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily this galaxy.  The Curators would still be here.  But we at least win the chance to keep playing."  I wanted to say one more thing, but we had agreed to hold it back for now.</p>

<p>"Well that still sounds better than getting zeroed out."</p>

<p>Emma said, "It's a bet I would take any day.  But I can't take it for you.  Or for any of you."</p>

<p>"Tell me something," Red said.  "When you were out there naked facing off against the murdersaurus, your husband here told my best hunter that you were in no danger whatsoever.  Is that true?"</p>

<p>"It is.  We can fold at will to the surface of any habitable world in the galaxy.  In the blink of an eye we could return to Earth or visit Prometheus or even Kattegat.  And even if we are inattentive our implants implement the wisdom of aeons of use experience.  Our implants saved us when the Yakuza ambushed us with the fold inhibitor.  Another Curator just went to a great deal of trouble to kill us, and again we are still here.  These are powerful modalities, and we need to have them for humans or we will have no defence if the Curators decide we are too much of a bother to tolerate."</p>

<p>"And you can give us these same powers?"</p>

<p>"Eventually.  We need to build up an infrastructure of nanoassembly and gene and protein editing.  The Curators have had that infrastructure for so long most of them don't even remember how it was originally assembled, but the implants do."</p>

<p>"And that's how you know all this, through your Curator implants?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then why would any of it be a surprise to the other Curators?"</p>

<p>I was about to speak but Emma cut me off.  "Because we hacked our implants.  Everything the Curators know about computer security could be written on your thumbnail in twenty-four point type."</p>

<p>I looked at her a bit sharply and she returned the look with a bit of "trust me" semi-blink.  </p>

<p>Later, after we shook everybody's hands and everyone went to their cabins to get drunk and think it over and we were back in the privacy of our own cabin, I said "Is there some reason for pretending it wasn't just goddamn luck that all the secrets got unlocked?"</p>

<p>"Well, it wasn't really dishonest; it <em>was</em> data security incompetence.  But there is another thing.  You realize, within a few years one of two things is going to happen.  If the Curators find out what we're doing too soon then all of these people are going to be dead.  But if that doesn't happen, then all of these people are going to become gods.  And since that's the only outcome worth planning for..."</p>

<p>"...you want to get them used to thinking like gods," I finished.</p>

<p>She nodded, and we put away the rest of our liter of wine in comfortable silence.</p>

<p><em>Five Years Later</em></p>

<p>A steady stream of tourists came to visit the <em>Nostromo</em> and fire exotic weapons at the dangerous animals of Terra Nova.  Few of them were aware of the vast works going on across Terra Nova's moon, which were producing real miracles.</p>

<p>The mortality Cure included a list of about two hundred standard biogenic fixes that could be applied with pure genetic and protein-editing techniques; a typical species only needs thirty to sixty of them, and when we started we didn't know which ones humans would need.  But five years later we had implemented them all, and some of our older team members were beginning to look noticeably younger.</p>

<p>Our self-replicating nanites were still very limited, but the bulk nanoassemblers, which would be a precursor technology to almost everything else, were coming along.  We needed them to do the really long-term biological fixes as well as our hoped-for implants.  Red came to see us one day with a silver sphere the size of a golf ball, and when we refused to guess what it was he proudly told us it was a multiplex supergravity fold drive.</p>

<p>"With this you could really build a spacecraft in your back yard, power it from a tablet battery, and take it to the stars," he said.</p>

<p>But while it was an impressive leap beyond our own technology, this was not what we were ultimately after.  We had to learn to create a shaped fold aperture, and to create something we called a massive microfold array which was necessary both to determine the shapes for fold apertures and to produce the neural interface by which implants were controlled.  We couldn't really even <em>start</em> on the neural interface until we had the microfold arrays perfected, and we were honestly probably going to have practical nanites before we got that far.</p>

<p>New members joined our team regularly, brought to interview on word of mouth from our other team members.  It wasn't hard to convince them to join especially once we had the first anti-ageing factors working.</p>

<p>Our Curator also came to visit once in awhile, and after a year or so he revealed to us that he had commandeered an amplifier belt.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't they kind of notice that it was missing?"</p>

<p>"My people operate on a fundamental assumption that if you have the code to call it and unlock it, then you must have the right to do so," he said.  "I'm sure the fellow I interviewed with at the time of Nemesis' defection just shrugged and put it off to someone his equal taking it for what must be a valid project."</p>

<p>"So you're going to make the Earth move?" Emma teased.</p>

<p>"Not really.  I realized that since you also gave me the ability to reprogram these things that I can use it to implement a short-range fold inhibitor that can be used without shutting down your entire world."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't she be able to fold a short distance out of it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, but if she folds from within the inhibitor field I will be able to trace and follow her.  I can make the field just large enough to prevent her escape."</p>

<p>"How would you pin her down though?  If she detects that there's no escape she will just burn her bioform and go find another psychopath to seduce.  We're alive today because the implant can move normally through space despite the fold inhibitor once it's disconnected from its bioform."</p>

<p>"I haven't worked that out yet.  Unfortunately there does not seem to be an external way to override a conscious directive by the owner of an implant, even with our unlocked powers and the amplifier.  If I could prevent her from consciously acting I could disable her implant and reset it, but she can easily stop me if she becomes aware of what I'm trying, and there are all kinds of alarms that can't be disabled.  The implant will give her every opportunity to counteract an external reset command before executing it."</p>

<p>We celebrated our progress with shots of fine Australian scotch and speculated on what might come next.</p>

<p>"She isn't trying to wipe out your species, if she ever did want to do that," he said.  "She is killing a woman every two or three days.  But she skips all over the Earth, so that any particular population center only sees her work once a month or less.  She has created a noticeable statistical uptick in the rate of horrific killings, but few human agencies even seem to suspect that a single entity is responsible for this planetwide phenomenon.  Instead they are acting as if it might be some kind of statistical indicator about an emerging tendency of your own people.  And if any humans did suspect the truth they would have no way to track her and prove it.  I can detect her fold operations at close range, but even then on a short-range fold like that the signal is so faint that even with the amplifier it takes me several hours to solve for her precise real world location, by which time she's moved on."</p>

<p>"At that rate if she <em>was</em> trying to wipe us out she'd be about as successful as we expect to be here at Terra Nova, and for the same reason," Emma said.</p>

<p>Once in awhile he brought a taunting letter from Nemesis.  We had hoped these would reveal some deterioration into ineffective madness but she seemed to have formed a comfortable and stable relationship with her homicidal human body-partner.  What would have been crazy risks for him as an ordinary human were now safe and her host fed his inner demons with ease.  Nemesis herself professed to enjoy watching the bloodbath through his eyes.  "He's quite the artist you know," she quipped several times.</p>

<p>"Doesn't this go against <em>millions of years</em> of life experience on her part?" Emma asked after reading one of these missives.</p>

<p>"You've never taken a new host," the Curator said.  "Even a child brings all kinds of new alien impressions and feelings which must be managed.  There are good reasons we don't take adult hosts.  Even though the Curator's backup image is much older than the consciousness of her host, an adult host brings a very rich world-view of its own.  This may be particularly true of a human host.  And once the implant connects it is the biological brain which does the thinking even if the implant is working to synchronize it to the backup.  It is probably less the case that she is using her host than that he is using her."</p>

<p>"But she said little of him was going into the backup, and he knew he wouldn't live all that long."</p>

<p>"And he probably doesn't care.  There may be more of him going into the backup than she realizes as her  consciousness bends to his form.  He is living the ultimate dream of risk-free ego gratification and she is high on the intensity of his feelings, which she isn't even trying to modulate." </p>

<p>"That could make her extraordinarily dangerous," Emma said.</p>

<p>"I agree, which is why I have taken on this project."</p>

<p>"You know, we could help," I said.</p>

<p>But he shook his head.  "When Nemesis rails about your irresponsibility, I understand her point.  It's partly on us for failing to Curate you.  But humans also have a great sense of <em>responsibility</em> which I've observed often in my life among you.  Not all of you, but many of you, are unafraid to step up and do what is necessary for your families or your allies.  And Nemesis is my problem.  If we created humans by our neglect, then we just as surely created her by that same neglect.  And my people are <em>not</em> stepping up.  I don't believe there is a force in the galaxy that could convince them to.  If I may, I think it is the most human thing I can do to step up in place of my people who are shirking their responsibility."</p>

<p>"We appreciate that," Emma said.  "We just wanted you to know that you don't need to go it alone."</p>

<p>"You have more on your plate than even my own people could imagine.  Attend to your project and let me attend to the problem of Nemesis.  I promise you that if I get completely stuck, I will ask you to become involved."</p>

<p>"Fair enough," I said, and Emma nodded and we finished off the Scotch.</p>

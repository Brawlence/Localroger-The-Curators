## Description ##

This project aims to provide series' ongoing translation into Russian. For archival purposes, [phantomjs](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs) script `download-reddit-posts.js` can be found in `phantomjs` directory. Once ran, it makes a list of links containing 'Curators' from /u/localroger/submitted. These links are then processed (by inserting the content of the post into template.hmtl).

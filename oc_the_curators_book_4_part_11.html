<p><em>Four Years Later</em></p>

<p>"You remember Terminus?"</p>

<p>Helen immediately pointed at an angle toward the floor.</p>

<p>"Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Hundreds of them.  All with numbers."  She pointed toward the wall.  "Six twenty-two is that way," she said.  "Not very important, but very close."</p>

<p>"That's one of the three human colonies in this star system," I said.  "Happens to be the most populous by an order of magnitude, since it's a planet and not the moon of a gas giant like Deucalion."</p>

<p>"What am I supposed to <em>do</em> with this?"</p>

<p>"Go there.  Would you like to see Terminus?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'm going to control your implant, but you will be able to feel what I'm doing so you can learn to do it for yourself.  Concentrate on Terminus like this."</p>

<p>We became aware of Terminus as a blank sphere, the protomap of a world.</p>

<p>"Even without an index your implant has powerful features.  You can look for a body of water."  We became aware of every body of water on Terminus, outlined on our virtual map.  "Or a mountain."  The map became topological, and we soared over it in virtual space.  "Or we can access the index, since this is a settled world."  Suddenly there were cities and infrastructure features.  "I suggest we go to the spaceport, since it's where newcomers are expected to arrive anyway."  We zoomed in on the facility, which was rendered in transparent three-dimensional detail.</p>

<p>"Your implant isn't recalling this detail from memory, it's using the microfold to scan our destination in real time.  Note that you can feel the velocity and orientation difference."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Our implants will have to correct those when we fold.  Curators teach us to try to appear where nobody will see us pop into existence."  We became aware of all the sentient bioforms in the spaceport.  "If we appear in this hallway, we won't be visible to anyone.  Ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'm setting this up, but it's your own implant folding you; mine doesn't have the capacity to take both of us this distance."  I gave the silent command and our surroundings changed.</p>

<p>"We're really here?"</p>

<p>"Seven hundred and fifty light-years," I said.  We walked out into the main concourse.  "Let's be polite and check you in with the locals."  I took her to the customs desk.</p>

<p>"An alien?" the customs officer asked.</p>

<p>"I am Helen of Deucalion," Helen said.</p>

<p>"Ahhh, one of our Promethean friends.  Welcome to Terminus.  How did you get here?  There hasn't been a transport from Deucalion in months."</p>

<p>"I'm Andrew, unofficial regent to Queen Emma," I said.</p>

<p>"OOOOOH, well in THAT case," the officer said, and he made a few pokes at a touch screen.  "Welcome to Terminus, both of you," he said.</p>

<p>"What was the point of that?" Helen asked.  "Can't we just come and go as we please?"</p>

<p>"We can," I said, "and there's not much the bureaucracy could really do about it.  But sometimes it helps if you follow the little rules to buy you some leverage when you have to break one of the big ones."  I took her up to the cafe which overlooked Terminus City and showed her some of the highlights.</p>

<p>"This is quite a place," she said.</p>

<p>"It's actually a pretty small city.  There are larger Promethean cities on Prometheus itself back in the Milky Way.  And this would just be a corner of any of the ancient Earth cities.  Would you like to meet our leader?  I'm sure Emma will want to meet you."</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>I showed her how to initiate a microfold connection.  "Emma has a Curator implant like ours," I told Helen.  When it replied I sent a request for physical meeting.  An instant reply accepted but asked us to wait half an hour.</p>

<p>"There aren't a lot of Curators out here at the Pinwheel, but that's how we network."</p>

<p>"There's so much to remember."</p>

<p>"Fortunately, you have an implant to help with that.  We've got a little time, have you ever had an ice cream sundae?"</p>

<hr />

<p>"So you're finally teaching her to use her implant?" Emma said when we appeared before her.</p>

<p>"Very first steps," I said.  "You can tell her what that's like."</p>

<p>"Do you have an urge to point at stuff in the sky?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>Helen nodded.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's about right.  Let's have tea."</p>

<p>Emma made small talk with Helen while I kept quiet.  I wanted Helen to understand that she wasn't the first to travel this path.</p>

<p>"We were novitiates for, what was it, about four months?" Emma said, looking at me.</p>

<p>"About that," I said.  "You were fast learners."</p>

<p>"Someone else was uplifted with you?" Helen asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, my husband Jay.  He's on Earth right now, in the Milky Way.  Are you headed there?"</p>

<p>Helen looked at me.</p>

<p>"Eventually," I said.  "Helen finds Deucalion a bit... pastoral."</p>

<p>"I've seen some of your art," Emma said.  "Your memories of that place... did you have a name for it?"</p>

<p>"We did," Helen said, "but it would just translate as something like 'Home' or 'Earth.'  We had no knowledge of other inhabited worlds, and in light of my new knowledge in this life there may not have been any others for us to find."</p>

<p>"Your art reminds me a lot of the Earth.  It is full of machines like those we built which don't exist anywhere else because if you have the fold you don't need them."</p>

<p>"Most of my thoughts are my own," Helen said, "but when we came here and I realized a machine had translated me over seven hundred light years in an instant, I felt a flush of wonder that I know came from my Ancestor's thought matrix."</p>

<p>"Hold on to that for as long as you can," Emma said.  "These galaxies <em>are</em> full of wonder."</p>

<p>"If I may ask, is there some reason the King isn't here with you?"</p>

<p>"We tend to stay apart most of the time since the attack, just in case."</p>

<p>"Attack?"</p>

<p>Emma looked at me.  "You haven't told her?"</p>

<p>"I wanted her to know it as a real place first."</p>

<p>"Told me what?"</p>

<p>Emma held up her hand.  She broadcast the memories so I could see what she was showing Helen.  It was a mini-montage of the solar bomb, the nearly instant destruction of the far side of Terminus including our close friend and confidant Quentin and his good ship the <em>Implausible Alibi.</em>  It shifted to the wall of flames and the evacuation, Emma raging on another world as she listened helplessly to the microfold news of her people dying.</p>

<p>"Who did this?" Helen asked aghast.</p>

<p>"The Curators, of course."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"We defied them, and they didn't like it."</p>

<p>"So they killed... they destroyed your <em>entire world?</em>"</p>

<p>"They tried to.  We came back though.  Humans will do that."</p>

<p>"We had a war like that once.  We called it the Flash War.  It was fought with thermonuclear weapons."</p>

<p>"There was a period when that might have happened on Earth.  Somehow we avoided it.  What did your people do afterward?"</p>

<p>Helen's eyes flashed.  "We vowed that it must never happen again.  And from that time until mine, anyone who suggested making that kind of war was subject to terrible sanction.  Often lethal.  My people had, as yours sometimes say, no sense of humor about it."</p>

<p>"Pretty much what we figured out on Earth.  We had other problems to confront.  We had fucked up the climate pretty badly and a lot of our population died without even a war to kill them."  She glanced downward for a moment.  "Jay and I corrected that."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"We had been granted Curator powers thanks to Andrew here, and we used them to express our displeasure."</p>

<p>Helen shook her head.  "I'm not getting this," she said.  "The Curators are evil enough to destroy a world, yet they gave you your powers, and Andrew is a Curator.  Where do they stand?"</p>

<p>"They are individuals," I said.  "We have great power, as you will soon.  But each of us chooses our own path."</p>

<p>"I'm terribly confused."</p>

<p>"Well my immediate suggestion is to make that feeling worse.  Want to go to the Milky Way?"</p>

<p>"I have to, don't I?"</p>

<p>"That's for you to decide.  But I think you know you need to find your destiny."</p>

<p>She nodded.  "What do I have to do?"</p>

<p>"We have to go back to the spaceport.  To travel between galaxies we need to take a ship."</p>

<p><em>For Immediate Release via Microfold Relay</em></p>

<p><em>Scope:</em> All-Galaxy</p>

<p><em>Section:</em> Galactic Mysteries</p>

<p><em>Origin:</em> Norma R18 Fore 3 Curator Index:829166</p>

<p><em>Translation Note:</em> Names with no recorded Earth equivalents are given Greek placeholders according to current Earth [CI:1742660] directive.</p>

<p><em>Title:</em> An Old Voice Finally Has Something to Say</p>

<p><em>Byline:</em> Alpha</p>

<p>Seventy thousand years ago the Curators quietly inserted a new world into their Index, in the thick of the Norma galactic arm.  It was removed from the quarantine list and as is usual began to show up in the microfold transaction relay, acknowledging that there was a working microfold transceiver there and that it had an operator.</p>

<p>And for seventy thousand years, that's all it ever did.  I actually traveled to an archivist world that keeps the best records to be sure, and did an electronic search.  All CI:829166 has <em>ever</em> had to say to the rest of the galaxy is <em>ACK</em>, yes we are here.  But they have never asked for any further discourse with the rest of us.</p>

<p>At least until last month.</p>

<p>In a galaxy with more than a million inhabited worlds there are going to be some oddballs, but few have made themselves as enduringly mysterious as CI:829166.  Five fold ships have investigated, all finding from orbit evidence of a primitive society with no obvious infrastructure and no means of providing orbital transfer support.  Until recently that also meant no way to land and investigate, so to this day we have no idea what the inhabitants of CI:829166 look like or why they have maintained their generational silence so completely.</p>

<p>One hint might come from their first message; in the comment field of the transfer protocol, which they had never used before, they placed the message "We made this ourselves without using nanites."  There was also, for the first time, a content-request packet, asking for an up to date and complete introduction to the most current version of the Galactic Common language.  Needless to say, that reply was transmitted on the very next cycle.</p>

<p>It also directed everyone's attention toward another world, Earth [CI:1742660] which burst onto the galactic stage within the last century with their own non nanite-based technology implementing tiny starships and powerful energy weapons.  All inquiries toward Earth have been met with insistent denial; they have no record of anyone from Earth or any of their colonies ever visiting CI:829166.  They insist they didn't even know what a mystery it was in some circles because, as one official put it, "why would we care."</p>

<p>Unfortunately it is the humans of Earth who are best equipped to investigate CI:829166, but they are also strongly implicated as the players who kicked 829166 out of its technological somnolescence.  Negotiations are ongoing but as their role in galactic trade has increased humans have given up the habit they once had of making very tiny explorational starships like the infamous <em>Grasshopper</em> and <em>Horse Pill</em>.  The humans have to take a productive starship out of service for at least a week to make an expedition to the Norma arm of the galaxy.  And while other races now have starships that can land, those are all huge nanite-based designs that might be a bit threatening if they approach the surface of any world uninvited.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, having gotten their dictionary, the natives of 829166 have been gradually extending their command of both the language and the transfer protocol in a way that makes it very believable that they really have built their own terminal from first principles.  The thing nobody can figure out is, if they have been so stubbornly incommunicative since their first days out of quarantine, how did they know enough Common to make their initial request?</p>

<p>As was our tradition the human-form Curator had brought a welcome fifth of Johnny Walker Blue.  "Your people aren't coming yet," he said as we clinked shot glasses, "but they will come."</p>

<p>"We are far from finished here," M said, and I nodded.</p>

<p>"My people are in agreement.  We do not want to see your work here stop.  But you have seeded it well, and a little vacation might be a good idea while this introduction kerfluffle works itself out.  The Prometheans just didn't realize what they were doing when they decided to say 'hello.'"</p>

<p>"So where should we vacate?" M asked.</p>

<p>"The safest place would be with the Witnesses, since they know your secret anyway."</p>

<p>"That asshole Q who tried to destroy their world is also staying with them," she said as she spat on the ground.</p>

<p>"We had an idea about that," the Curator said.  "You probably won't like it much, but please hear me out.  It offers little risk, keeps you away from Q except for a few hours, and gives him a chance to prove he is not what you remember him to be."</p>

<p>M wasn't happy about it at all, but try as she might she couldn't think of a valid reason to turn the proposal down.  So a week later we found ourselves on the <em>Plausible Deniability</em> with both the Curator and Q, traveling back from the Witnesses' world to Prometheus.  M was doing a slow burn but she was carrying out the plan.</p>

<p>"I would have brought him myself but I don't have an amplifier belt," the Curator said apologetically.  "By the time the situation escalates to a point where such an item might be released, it could easily be too late to help."</p>

<p>"I appreciate the ride," Q said.</p>

<p>"Don't thank me, I'm just driving the jalopy," M said in a voice dripping with venom.</p>

<p>"Look, I can't change what I once was.  Please consider at least the possibility that I have changed and consider how I might prove it to you."</p>

<p>"An heroic death would do nicely," M said.</p>

<p>"That is a distinct possibility," the Curator said.  "Q is going to provide a cover story for you and there is some risk to him in doing so.  We will not be able to provide cover for him."</p>

<p>"Fine, we'll see," M said.</p>

<p>"I don't see how that could possibly work," I said.</p>

<p>"Me and my bros were just trashing around the galaxy when we got in an argument and they dumped me on this dipshit world I eventually named Prometheus," Q said in an eerie return to his pre-enlightenment speech mannerisms.  "Haven't seen them since and don't know where the ship is now.  Oh, the <em>illegal</em> ship with the fold drive that was supposed to be destroyed, you guys might be real interested in who I used to work for.  So here I was on this primitive dump and they figured I'd never make my way back to the galaxy again, but turns out these Promethean dudes are pretty hip to tech that they are able to make themselves, so I gave them a little help."</p>

<p>"Pretty slick," I said, "but the people who are after all of us might come for you."</p>

<p>"I know.  Maybe M will get her heroic death before this is over.  If so I'm OK with that."</p>

<p>"This is pretty high-profile on human worlds for the moment," the Curator said.  "It would be quite risky for them to pull anything on the recon visit.  And with this ship 'gone' we think it might be a bit difficult for them to justify another clandestine run to try and extract Q.  If they haven't tried in a month or two it will almost certainly indicate a lack of will.  It's costing them a fair amount of revenue to sideline a ship for this visit and there is almost exactly zero profit for anybody to make by repeating it."</p>

<p>"And one thing Earth is still all about is money.  Even our colonies think they're crazy now," Q finished.</p>

<p>"Yeah, we should wake up and smell the nanites," M said, finally finding something to complain about other than Q.</p>

<p>An hour later we had dropped Q off and were on our way back to the Witnesses.  "Okay," M said now that she could breathe a little easier, "what do you think the chances are of this stupid plan succeeding?"</p>

<p>"Well, on the point of giving you cover so you can come back safely in a few months and continue your work here, we are pretty sure it will work.  His presence will neatly explain what happened here and there is no reason for anyone to come back once that explanation is in place until the Prometheans are in a position to trade on their own.  That is unlikely to happen for at least thirty or forty more years even at their highly accelerated rate of development."</p>

<p>"So I guess Q will be vacationing with the Witnesses for awhile afterward."</p>

<p>"Not really.  There are seven more unaccounted-for fold drives, and we are sure there must be other ships like this one.  They will almost certainly send an extraction crew after him.  Q is well versed in how his former masters think.  Q is himself well trained but his heart is not into violence as it was when he was a highly effective commando.  I consider his chances of surviving this less than ten percent."</p>

<p>"Does he know this?" M asked.</p>

<p>"His estimate is less than five percent."</p>

<p>"Yay for Q then," M said with a heavy sigh, and we made the rest of the trip back to the Witnesses in silence.</p>

<p>We had been with the silver-furred Curator for close to a month, surveying the tribes of a scaly bipedal species which were at about the level of development of our own Australopithecine ancestors.  She told us that they had mastered the use of rock hammers and bone clubs without Curator help.  They were using fire in increasingly necessary ways for their evolving lifestyle, but they had not learned to make fire from scratch yet and that might be grounds for an intervention.</p>

<p>They numbered about thirty thousand in eighty or so tribes living in a region of about fifty thousand square kilometers of mixed forest and grassland.  They had followed the common pattern of moving from an arboreal life, which had given them good vision and spatial awareness, to walking on the ground.  In their new ground-bound existence they increasingly needed fire to ward off threats at night and to cook their food, which was increasingly protein based.  They had learned to tend fires carefully but all the tribes were subject to the occasional loss of their seed fire, and then they had to wait for a fortunate lightning strike or an encounter with another tribe to make a new one.  Such fireless periods were increasingly dangerous for them, and it had happened on a few occasions that all the tribes lost their fire at the same time due to a widespread weather catastrophe, and those incidents now threatened them with extinction.</p>

<p>We watched them at night since that was when their fire tending habits were most on display.  Our camp was on the far side of the world so we could rest when we weren't observing them.  The Curator had simply given us the coordinates and told us to show up with portable shelter; on an interstellar jump that limited us to a few kilograms of gear.  We asked if there would be trees, and she said of course there would be trees, so we brought a covered hammock.  She watched curiously as we set it up.  Her own shelter was a tent of impossibly thin and strong fabric which inflated itself and stiffened to hardness, and maintained its shape despite having openings.  It was well beyond human technology.</p>

<p>"Considering your technology, your approach to the problem is elegant," she said of the hammock.</p>

<p>Fortunately our implants made it unnecessary to pack in food, water, or fire for our expedition.  But almost all the Curators' children had circadian rhythms which enforced a daily period of rest most easily observed in darkness.</p>

<p>The Curator was evaluating which tribe would be the optimal recipient of a Prometheus Stone.  Parameters included how likely they would be to need it and how often, incentivizing them to learn its lessons, and how likely they would be to meet other tribes and pass their new skill along once the stone had done its work.  We understood that this was a complex problem the Curators had evaluated millions of times and listened attentively as she explained each step of the reasoning both in our investigation and her final decision.</p>

<p>We observed from the distance, cloaked by our invisibility shields and the night.  Our implants made it possible to listen as if we were present in each tribe's camp, and we had a good understanding of their primitive language and its already spreading variations.  Each tribe had a favored territory which overlapped those of other tribes, and migration routes which both intersected each other and varied over time in ways the Curator had been studying for some time.</p>

<p>Finally she announced her decision.  "This is one of the larger tribes, and is likely to split within a generation or two; it has a large territory with high fan-out for encounters with the other tribes.  And a storm system is moving in which is quite likely to douse their fire in a few days."  She reached into the fabric pouch she used to carry field equipment and produced what looked like a piece of petrified wood.  She handed it to Emma.  It had a small depression in one side, and when Emma passed her hand over it a small flame appeared.</p>

<p>"This doesn't look like the one we saw at the Sevillian museum," Emma said.</p>

<p>"We have different versions.  This one relies less on symbol reading since these creatures aren't making symbolic markings yet.  At first it will simply give them fire, but over time it will require more and more of the practical skill of making and operating a fire drill in order to work.  Eventually their skill will be perfect, and it will stop working, forcing them to try their technique on real wood."</p>

<p>"What if they don't notice it?"</p>

<p>"Once it's placed in initiation mode it will glow continuously until it is picked up and activated.  They don't seem likely to move from where they are before the storm system arrives so they will probably need it while they are still here where it can attract their attention.  In some situations we might help them by extinguishing their regular fire ourselves, but I don't think that will be necessary here."</p>

<p>The Curator let Emma carry the stone to them.  The invisibility cloak wasn't perfect but early in the morning when the fire was burning low and most of the creatures were fast asleep she easily snuck in and tucked it into the embers of their fading fire.  When Emma got back the Curator and I were examining telemetry readings from the stone.</p>

<p>"You placed it well," the Curator said.  "There's an excellent chance they will activate it simply by renewing the fire as it is.  That will let them know what it can do when they truly need it.  A million years from now this may turn out to be the most important event in this race's history.  Or it may come to nothing; we can never be sure."</p>

<p>"It's a bit overwhelming to think of what I just did that way."</p>

<p>"You are Curators now.  What you just did is the very essence of Curation."</p>

<p>We continued to watch the tribe for a few more evenings, and as expected the rains came and doused the fire.  They had noticed the stone and put it aside, as wary of it as they were curious, but when the fire died there was a great flutter of argument among them before one of them deliberately made it produce a flame.  After that they went about gathering the driest kindling they could find and soon had their main fire restarted.  Soon we observed that the individual who had made that flame on the night of the storm was keeping the stone with him, apparently at the urging of the tribe's alpha leader.</p>

<p>"This is an interesting development," the Curator told us.  "The leader is probably a little afraid of it, but they all recognize its usefulness and power.  Delegating a power like this to another is an important step on the road toward making complex societies that can perform deep planning and execute nontrivial projects.  And it's not usually directly related to the acquisition of fire."</p>

<p>"Most primitive human societies that we've studied had a broad division between what you might call alpha leadership and the vocation of consulting the gods," I said.  "Could this person become their first witch doctor?"</p>

<p>"Humans followed that path because, not being curated, your ancestors had no idea where such powers came from.  Eventually these creatures will know how they benefitted from our intervention, but it's too early now.  They don't have the faculties to properly assess their role in the universe yet."</p>

<p>Back in Terlingua, six weeks after leaving, we caught Quentin up on our adventure.</p>

<p>"Their role in the universe?  What do you suppose the <em>Curators</em> think those creatures' role in the Universe is <em>supposed to be</em>?"</p>

<p>It was a good question and one we couldn't easily answer, except to observe that the way she had said it, it seemed clear that their role in the universe would never compare to that of the Curators.  And for all the benefit we were bringing to them, the Curators' methods might just be designed at least in part to make sure it stayed that way.</p>

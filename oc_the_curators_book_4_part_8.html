<p>The presence of several million Curators on Earth made the Curators' ability to take new hosts a bit of a touchy subject among humans.  Arriving Curators were made aware that our hospitality did not extend to making our children available as hosts, and they had to agree to this before  entering our world.</p>

<p>And to the Curators' credit in six hundred years there had never been an instance of a human Earth child suddenly showing up with an implant, and those of optimal age were scanned regularly just to be sure.  But even if we found parental volunteers it was clear that a new human Curator made in this way would not be tolerated by a large fraction of our population.</p>

<p>We would also need a Curator implant, and those weren't being made any more.</p>

<p>These considerations were all front and center as I celebrated the millennium in San Francisco with Callie, Andrew, Red, Veronica, and Jay.  Emma was hosting the ball drop at Terminus City, which was being broadcast across the Pinwheel via the microfold.  The microfold didn't provide the range for us to broadcast from galaxy to galaxy, but we had gone to some trouble to synchronize things with atomic clocks.</p>

<p>Like most Earth cities San Francisco was a much smaller city than it had once been, and some of its famous ancient iconic buildings were gone, but the Mark Hopkins hotel and the Top of the Mark were still there both having been upgraded and renovated dozens of times.  All of the bar's fixtures were different but it still served a famous array of martinis, and it still offered stunning views of the city and the bay.  The wait staff passed out champaigne as local midnight approached.  Off-world they celebrated at Greenwich Mean Time but on Earth itself the new year was still a local phenomenon.</p>

<p>We spoke freely because our booth was protected by a microfold stabilized layer of soundproof air.  It was quiet for us as the party raged all around.</p>

<p>"I don't think it's so critical to treat the rover with kid gloves any more," I said.  "We have the original scan and can restore it to its found state if something goes badly wrong."</p>

<p>"I don't understand why it's even so important," Callie said.  "If we can wake up its full bioform we don't even need the rover."</p>

<p>"That's not the whole story," Red said.  "The rover also carries a lot of technical documentation.  Those diagrams and schematics it shows us aren't part of its thought matrix, they're external augmentation.  A bioform host would only have human style imperfect and incomplete memories of those pages.  We need the rover to upload or show them to us."</p>

<p>"How much can there still be?"</p>

<p>"We think a lot," I said.  "It doesn't know a lot about things like its bioform species and homeworld since such memories would be needlessly distracting to its mission design, but it seems to have a pretty complete understanding of the technology that was used to build it.  There's still a lot we could learn."</p>

<p>"Why would that be?  The rover isn't in a position to actually use that kind of knowledge."</p>

<p>"Why not?" I countered.  "It's just a few cubic centimeters of nanoassembled computronium which doesn't even use energy unless it's being accessed.  You never know when something like that might turn out to be useful."</p>

<p>"Like how to use your implant to accelerate a hundred kilos of ice at a third of the speed of light," Veronica said with a wry smile.</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>Our waitress stuck her head through the sound barrier.  "Third millennium in less than a minute guys," she winked.  I disabled the barrier so we could hear the countdown.</p>

<p>"It's not the third millennium until next year," Red said, but he was smiling as we all groaned.</p>

<p>"I was there and I can testify that the year one BCE is also the year zero CE."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah?" Veronica said.  "And what happened in the year zero, smart guy?"</p>

<p>"Nothing.  That's why it was the year zero."  And everyone laughed.</p>

<p>At that the countdown reached ten seconds and we joined in as the old year 2999 gave way to the new year 3000, and five galaxies of new possibilities.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Don't you have some kind of validation process you can use to verify a file before you merge it with your consciousness?" one of the emulation researchers asked me one day.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's in that control block the rover's pass code unlocked."</p>

<p>"Do you think you could accept an upload and check it?  We've done the edits to restore the rover's consciousness to what we think will be its original biological configuration when it was scanned.  It would be nice to know we did everything right."</p>

<p>I spent half an hour accepting the upload over the legacy radio link and then ran the validation.  "It passes," I said.  "That doesn't mean it's correct though, just that there are no obvious encoding errors.  We have a lot to do before trying to use this thing."</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"We have to risk both a life and an implant, both of which we have to source, and if it even works we have to figure out how that being will pass among other humans once we create it."</p>

<p>"There are millions of Curators on Earth, surely one of them might <em>cough</em> lose its implant."</p>

<p>"They came here in good faith, and they've respected our wishes about taking human children as hosts.  I'm not going to do that to any of them.  If we could locate the remnant Plasma, particularly in possession of one of the solar bomb prototypes, I'd consider stealing one of <em>their</em> implants but we've had no progress in that direction and given the scale of the galaxy we might not for thousands more years."</p>

<p>"Fair enough," she said, and I thought that was that.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Six hundred years earlier</em></p>

<p>It was less than two months after I released the fold-following worm that the Promethean embassy on Earth politely requested a meeting with our government.  Red and I were both at that meeting, as were representatives of the four major geopolitical parties, the current President, and the ambassador from the Pinwheel, who at that moment was neither Jay nor Emma.  In that day there were no other colonized galaxies to be represented.</p>

<p>"We come to ask if there is any possibility that we could apply for a colony world at your Pinwheel galaxy," the Promethean ambassador said.  "We hasten to add that we would only ever want or need one world, just as we only need the one we inhabit here.  But we would be honored to have a hand to help and eyes to witness what you will do over there."</p>

<p>"That would involve making a world habitable, and transporting your colonists," Red said.</p>

<p>"We will take care of transportation.  We know it will be more time-consuming and perhaps riskier to make the journey with our technology, but we will manage.  We will ask that you arrange what you call a DENT world for us to inhabit.  We understand that this does not involve much expense for you at this point."</p>

<p>"That's true," I said, "but you do realize DENT technology is all nanite driven, right?  It's the very high-tech stuff you guys rejected."</p>

<p>"We reject the Curators' version.  We do not believe your nanite tech is a trap meant to control us by limiting our capabilities or providing you with back doors to disable our critical ventures."</p>

<p>"That is true," the Pinwheel ambassador said.  "None of our own people would trust a world built with such a technology.  We can of course spare you a small world, probably the moon of a gas giant.  But you would be isolated in a galaxy full of humans."</p>

<p>"We expect to get along well with your species.  But honestly, we have also come to believe it would be a good idea to have a population of our kind which is not in this galaxy in case the Curators turn out to be more genocidal than we expect."</p>

<p>It was hard to argue with that, but the Pinwheel government had to agree and their ambassador boarded the next ferry to take up the matter at home.  In due course Pinwheel DENT world 2720 was granted to the Prometheans.  It was the moon of a gas giant in a system that had three other human DENT colonies.</p>

<p>The Prometheans began making journeys in their own ships which took tens of thousands of folds and months of time to traverse the intergalactic void, but they carried out their promise to perform their own colonization.  They didn't need to move huge numbers of people because they weren't trying to relieve a large population back at home; instead, they were trying to build a separate one in case something very bad might happen at the Milky Way.</p>

<p>The Prometheans chose to name their world at the Pinwheel Deucalion.  In human myth Deucalion was both the son of Prometheus and the Greek version of Noah, who saved his family from Zeus' genocidal deluge by building a floating chest.  The Prometheans thought this was an appropriate name because the settlers of Deucalion might very well be the only survivors if the Curators chose to take out their original homeworld.</p>

<hr />

<p>"We have business at Deucalion," Red told me one day.</p>

<p>"With the Prometheans?"  </p>

<p>"And others," Red said.  "It's complicated, and easier to explain on site."</p>

<p>I boarded Red's fast transport and went with him to the Prometheans' world at the Pinwheel.  There we made our way to the residence of the First Prefect.  "Do you still carry the reconstructed image of the unedited Ancestor?" Red asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said.</p>

<p>"We have a recipient for it."</p>

<p>"Who would allow..."  And as I was asking this, the Prefect and her mate stood aside to reveal a crib and a Promethean infant.</p>

<p>"You have got to be kidding me," I said.</p>

<p>"You humans are so silly," the Prefect's mate said.  "Even in our darkest days of defying the Curators, had one of them come to us and offered to elevate our child to walk among the gods, who in their right mind would resist such a thing?"</p>

<p>"We don't know if this being would be as the gods, or even as a Curator.  It might not work at all."</p>

<p>"A risk we have decided is worth taking," the Prefect said.</p>

<p>"Well that's nice, but we still need an implant, and I don't think we have any of those lying around."</p>

<p>I became aware of footsteps and a new presence in the room.  I turned and saw that it was Veronica.  "I have offered mine," she said.</p>

<p>"Veronica, your implant is synchronized now.  You're effectively immortal."</p>

<p>"I'm only immortal if I'm willing to take a new host when this body dies, and I can't see myself doing that," she said.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You once asked me a question which I refused to answer at the time.  The answer was twenty-nine.  Not counting Nemesis, which I don't count because that thing wasn't human any more."</p>

<p>I just looked at her, uncharacteristically stumped for words.</p>

<p>"There are others, almost anybody else really, who deserve this gift more than I did.  You know you just gave me the implant because you didn't want to cede it back to the Curators and I was there to receive it.  As I see it the most useful thing I have done with the implant is to keep it available for this moment."  </p>

<p>She nodded toward the Promethean infant.  "This being might tell us things we have no other way of learning.  This is not a snap decision, Andrew.  We have discussed it at length and made our decisions."</p>

<p>I looked around the room and realized that I was boxed in.  They had all planned it well, and there was really no rational basis for me to resist what they were asking me to do.</p>

<p>"You will have to unlock your implant so I can clear it," I told Veronica.  "Once that is done there is no going back."</p>

<p>"I know.  Tell me what to do."</p>

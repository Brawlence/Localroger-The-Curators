<p><em>Early Twentieth Century</em></p>

<p>The oddest thing about the Great War (obviously nobody yet knew it would
eventually become World War <em>One</em>) was that nobody seemed to know why they
were fighting.  Everybody seemed to be in the conflict because someone else
was, not because they wanted to be.  Yet the tangle of relationships among
the aristocratic class seemed to make it all necessary even though nobody
would admit to wanting it.</p>

<p>The internal combustion engine made tanks and aircraft possible, and larger,
faster firing, more precise firearms and made the killing fields far more 
lethal than they had been for the Americans sixty years earlier.  Some of
our agents had to fold ourselves out of danger more times in the short course
of that war than we had in sixty thousand years observing the human race.
I had to personally fold away from two different sinking ships.</p>

<p>It was the most futile and violent thing anybody in the Milky Way could
remember.  And while those who directed us were quite smug that this signaled
the impending demise of humanity, we agents on Earth noted that when it was
done the humans buried their dead, rebuilt their cities, generally resumed
trade among themselves and continued to exist rather robustly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a man named Edward Bernays, taking advantage of early private access
to the work of his uncle Sigmund Freud, was inventing the humans' most dangerous
technology yet:  The ability to influence each other en masse through the 
techniques of propaganda.  A tendency toward rationalism which had been
gradually pushing religion aside abruptly reversed course in many ways, and
large populations were efficiently and deliberately manipulated into enthusiastic
support for things that should have been very obviously against their real
interests.</p>

<p>When World War Two began nobody was in any doubt as to why it was being fought.
It was spun up through fomented xenophobia and launched out of crass greed.
The propagandists did their job too well and convinced themselves of their 
own superiority and the subhumanity of their enemies, and they acted
accordingly.  Their enemies saw how this was done and reacted in kind.</p>

<p>And this time the technology was even more dangerous.  Tactics had also
improved since they had the example of World War One to study, which did not
really help since the weapons were so much more powerful and the players so
much more ruthless.</p>

<p>Of course we became aware of the giant project the Americans were undertaking
to release atomic energy; nobody in the galaxy had ever bothered to try this
and we weren't convinced ourselves that it would work until the Trinity test.
And at that the six of us who had been recruited to live among the humans all
those thousands of years ago decided to hold a rare personal meeting to decide
what to do about it.  It was now clear that our Curator handlers were just as
wrong about everything as the humans might well be.  If we just watched while
the humans did what they might be about to do, we would survive; we might go
into emulation but we could all take new hosts.  And we would have to live with 
the memory of whatever we were about to experience on Earth for a <em>very</em> long time.</p>

<p><em>Present Day</em></p>

<p>Jay and Emma invited me to accompany them to visit a world which had been
settled by a small group of iconoclasts.  Their world was not in any sense
one we would normally consider worth terraforming, but as promised when we
folded in we were able to breathe normally on the surface.</p>

<p>"Welcome," the team leader said and we shook his hand.  "I'm David."  He
introduced his colleagues John, Jim, Luke, Kathryn, and his mother Carol.</p>

<p>"What are we looking at?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"A livable world," David answered with a sweeping gesture.  "Not perfect
yet but quickly getting there even though when we came here it was far 
too small, too cold, too dark, and subject to the radiation belts of the gas
giant it orbits.  We have solved all these problems, and very easily, by
seeding it with nanites and letting them work.  We call the process DENT,
Direct Extreme Nanite Terraforming."</p>

<p>"But why?" Emma pressed.</p>

<p>"Habitable worlds needn't be precious.  In fact naturally habitable worlds
are a <em>liability</em> because their stars age and change in brightness, and
as the Curators found if everything isn't perfectly tuned your atmosphere
blows away or there's a runaway greenhouse or your world wobbles sideways
so each pole faces the sun for half the year.  None of those things matter
with DENT.  Virtually the whole surface of this world is now nanites to a
considerable depth.  They regulate the composition of the atmosphere and 
its temperature, they generate a magnetic field and increase the gravity,
they keep the temperature steady, and where necessary they provide 
artificial light.</p>

<p>"What about failures?" Jay asked.</p>

<p>"What about them?" Carol countered.  "This is a <em>world</em>.  It has millions
of everything buried in its nanite crust.  All the important systems are
redundant to a factor of thousands or even millions."</p>

<p>"This is only possible because human nanite researchers made the direct
power nanites," David added.  "The Curators couldn't have done it, at
least with the nanites they gave their children.  This world easily taps
as much energy as it needs directly from the core of its sun.  I find it
hard to believe the Curators couldn't have made those nanites if they 
wanted to, but they obviously didn't want to."</p>

<p>"Curator nanites are more about Curator control than curated self-reliance,"
I said.  "They would be appalled at this."  I looked around and added, 
"I like it."</p>

<p>"We kind of got that impression," David said.</p>

<p>"So what do you need from us?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"Just be aware of what is possible.  We have heard that we might need
to eventually evacuate the human colonies of the Milky Way.  DENT is
not just versatile, it is fast; the nanites have only been at work 
here for about ten Earth years, and this world is already as habitable
as any of the other new worlds of the Pinwheel.  It will eventually also
have large tracts of soil planted with vegetation, but we don't <em>need</em> 
that vegetation to support life.  And we will have closer control over 
the mix of untamed animal life than a natural planet."</p>

<p>"No mosquitoes?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"Or rats," Carol said with a smile.  "Even if someone brings them the
whole world is literally against them."</p>

<p>"This seems a lot like a spaceship," Jay said.  "Why bother with the
planet at all?"</p>

<p>"We've been looking into that too," David said.  "There are other ideas
like shell worlds, ringworlds, and so on, but planets are abundant and
provide the nanites with plenty of working matter and a stable platform.
Planets have an outdoors with a sky -- a very impressive sky in this 
case on the hemisphere that faces our gas giant.  A lot of people would
consider a shell world or spaceship to be a claustrophobic box, and a 
ringworld requires implausibly strong materials that we're not sure are
possible even with this new technology."</p>

<p>"You could just hold them together with gravity plating," I said.</p>

<p>"True, but redundancy is an issue.  The failure mode is much more catastrophic
than even a large scale asteroid strike would be here."</p>

<p>"This is good to know about," I said.  "There are some people I know will
want to visit."</p>

<p>"Send anybody you think will find it instructive," Carol said.  "Our door
is open to all."</p>

<p>"The fate of the human colonies in the Milky Way is an issue.  We may not
be able to protect them from the Curators indefinitely."</p>

<p>"With DENT you can have as much space as you need in ten or twenty years.
More stars have candidate worlds and many have multiple candidates.  There
are three other gas giant moons in this system which are just as inviting
as this one.  And this system doesn't even <em>have</em> any small rocky worlds
in their own orbits; it seems those got swept away during system formation."</p>

<p>"Do you mind if we explore a bit?" Jay asked.</p>

<p>"Of course not, go anywhere you wish; the whole surface is habitable now."
He looked at me.  "I know Emma and Jay, and if you're who I think you are,
then you all have the ability to take yourselves home when you wish, or
you can come back here and ask us about anything."</p>

<p>We all nodded and said thanks, then at Emma's suggestion we folded to a
point about a third of the world's circumference away from the headquarters.
There was a small lake being fed by a river from some nearby hills; it was 
not clear whether this was part of a hydrological cycle or something powered
by pumps.  But here we could watch the gas giant's surface as solar 
nightfall overtook us.</p>

<p>"Impressive," Emma said.  "We don't have any other worlds where you could
stand outside and see something like this."  In addition to the gas giant
several of its other moons showed visible discs and crescents.</p>

<p>"Andrew, do you really think we might need to evacuate the Milky Way?
Earth is our homeworld after all."</p>

<p>"I don't know.  Right now we are at an impasse with the Curators.  Having 
lived as a human for so long I can think of a few things they could do to
make our lives much more difficult, but I don't know if they will think of
those things or if they do would be willing to go through with them.  I
know they think they are better than us, but I knew humans who felt they
were too good to do the bad things which they then did anyway.  And I no 
longer believe that Curators are any better than humans.  If anything they
may be more in denial about their origin and inner nature."</p>

<p>"That's a little terrifying," Emma said.</p>

<p>"It should be," I said, and we watched the sky for awhile before folding
back to Terminus.</p>

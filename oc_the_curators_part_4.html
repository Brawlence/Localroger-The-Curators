<p>The Foldship project was of course one of the most important and high-security projects in human history, but I was the only human to make the side trip to the world I had called Pompeii and the opportunity to debrief me about that was enough to get me an appointment with the project director.</p>

<p>He didn't seem to find much that I said surprising, although I was surprised that he called the world I had visited "Pompeii."  "Oh, somebody seems to have given them some names," he said in a tone half way between jovial and sneering.</p>

<p>"It was just a shorthand for the translator," I said.</p>

<p>"So you obviously thought at the time.  What you didn't realize is those little tablets they have aren't very smart.  They can't play what we would consider proper video, and they only have a few megabytes of local storage.  They are completely dependent on a microfold link to a data processing center on their homeworld to do anything useful.  Since they have as much energy as they want from fold technology those centers are enormous -- cubic miles in extent.  Every inhabited world in the galaxy has several."</p>

<p>"Wait, what, they are in real-time communication across light-years?"</p>

<p>"Amazing, isn't it.  For computers comparable to something we would have made in 1990."</p>

<p>"But they've been spacefaring for hundreds of thousands of years."</p>

<p>"Yes, but they've also been Curated.  They were given nanites.  That makes it so easy for them to build what they have, the effort to go beyond what the nanites can do never seems to have been invested."</p>

<p>"I have to ask you something.  My friend K told me that a fold drive can destroy a planet."</p>

<p>"It was telling the truth.  Our new friends don't seem to do guile well."</p>

<p>"And our people knew this?"</p>

<p>"Of course.  There are three fundamental constants which determine the extent and range of the fold effect, and there is no way to find out what they are except to make a fold.  And if you get them wrong, it will fold the two nearest large masses together.  Which is why we made our first experimental foldship a robotic interplanetary probe and did our first experiments from the Mars-Solar Langrange 3 point when Earth was on the far side of the Sun from Mars.  Since we didn't know the constants our first experiments were unbalanced, and this is what our friends detected before they moved to save us from our folly."</p>

<p>"How close did we come to annihilation?"</p>

<p>"Give us some credit.  We might have folded Mars into the Sun, but even that was very unlikely.  And we would have figured the constants out for ourselves within a year.  Our experimental protocol was on track when our new friends surprised us by arriving."</p>

<p>"K said they use the danger to warn their young to be responsible."</p>

<p>"Yes, not a bad idea.  But the Curators give them the values for the constants.  None of them have ever had to exercise caution to learn them the hard way, at risk."</p>

<p>"K said some species were still, as it said, careless."</p>

<p>"Well you can't cure stupid."</p>

<p>"Stupid normally can't destroy a planet."</p>

<p>"Stupid can destroy more than you realize.  Ever study World War One?"</p>

<p>"Okay, but has it ever occurred to anybody to make this thing into a weapon instead of a travel device?"</p>

<p>"Fancy a drink?"  The Director produced a bottle of 1800 Scotch from a desk drawer and I nodded somberly.  "Of course we have," he said as he poured me a straight shot.  "We also asked as closely as we dared if our alien friends had ever done so.  The answer in every context was no.  Making a foldship into a planet-killer also makes it a suicide run, because the foldship also folds itself into the star."</p>

<p>"So it can't be used that way?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say that.  As with their less than stellar computing devices none of them seem to have autonomous probes with fold drives.  Their fold ships need sentient guidance to operate, and they also don't seem to have the concept of suicide as triumph."</p>

<p>"And our very first fold ship is an autonomous probe," I said.</p>

<p>The Director held up his shot glass, and I joined him in a rather morbid salute to my species.</p>

<p>"Just how easy is it to make a fold drive?" I asked.  "Some of our fellow humans would fold us into the Sun just for spite."</p>

<p>"It's far too easy if you have the nanites and the programming system, which is common on their worlds.  We have told the aliens we are afraid of what the Curators might do if they find that we've been given that technology, but we're really more afraid of our own people getting it.  We're also not planning to duplicate their ground to orbit technology any time soon for similar reasons.  Fortunately they don't have much of an answer for ground to orbit if there isn't a fold-based ground infrastructure waiting for them, and making them rely on our chemical rockets gives us a bit of a barrier."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, how do they deal with new worlds then?"</p>

<p>The Director poured himself another shot, offered, and I accepted.  "There are really no new worlds for these guys," he said as he tossed it back.  "The worlds they discover have been Curated and have transport networks, as the Curators intended.  They don't seek out uninhabited or primitive worlds and wouldn't know what to do with one if they stumbled across it."</p>

<p>"I think I need to get back to my practice," I said as the scotch began to make its effect known.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think that would be a very good idea.  Your clinic is in the middle of an excellent path for a new highway and the eminent domain papers are ready to be delivered."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"We don't know shit about this galaxy we find ourselves living in, and you have an inside track to learn more.  Investigate this 'Mark of the Curators' with your friend K.  We will pay you fabulously well.  It is one of the few things our mostly incurious new friends are very curious about.  And frankly, we are pretty curious here too.  You see, it's not the races the Curators have groomed that we fear.  They have all settled at a tech level we think we can match in a few decades, and have already exceeded in some areas.  Beyond our worry about what our own assholes would do with their technology, it's the Curators themselves that we fear.  We don't know why they Curate, and we don't know why they didn't Curate us.  We don't know the extent of their power.  They are obviously active in the present day and we don't know what they might do when they realize we have appeared on the galactic stage."</p>

<p>"I'm just a dermatologist," I protested.  "You want me to suddenly be James Bond?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we want you to be far more than just James Bond.  Bond didn't have to deal with a galaxy full of alien species.  Hell, he only went into low Earth orbit once in the movies.  You've already visited and named two alien worlds orbiting other stars.  And it turns out you are just what your species needs, because it is a mark on the skin that is at the core of all of this.  We don't know anything about the Curators, and we don't know much about the few aliens we've met, but we know a lot about ourselves, and we know that even though we weren't Curated we come from the same basic Curator tree of life they do.  And one thing I know about humans is that when we put a mark on something it's often because we think we own it."</p>

<p>So it was that a week later I was on another rocket shuttle, headed back to K's foldship and the world I had named Seville.  But this time I did something that was expressly forbidden in the densely worded contract I had once signed.</p>

<p>I loaded up some carefully selected apps and files and packed my cellphone and a solar charger.</p>

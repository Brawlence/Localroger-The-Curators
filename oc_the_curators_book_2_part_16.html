<p>The curation of early multicellular life turned out to lack drama.  Although great changes were occurring as we visited more and more developed worlds, those changes were mostly visible only through the lens of a microscope or the output of a gene sequencer.  All the worlds we visited had blue skies and seas with blue-green shallows and land masses that were mostly still sterile brown and grey.  No dramatic interventions were contemplated, and none of the worlds was expected to fail; if life did not develop appropriately by a certain point in the host star's evolution, it would be kicked by seeding with viruses or entirely new organisms as appropriate.</p>

<p>"The evolution of the host star is what drives us," the team leader explained.  "It takes enormous amounts of time for the kind of changes we want to see to happen by chance, but as we wait the star is also burning its nuclear fuel, becoming hotter and nearer to the nova that will make it a red giant.  The habitable zone moves out as the star gets hotter, and generally a world that is near the outside of the habitable zone when we form its moon will be inside the zone and uninhabitable long before the nova.  We try to make sure life becomes complex in time to enjoy some aeons of that complexity before it is annihilated."</p>

<p>It takes a succession of small miracles for organisms that start as loose confederations of single-celled organisms to develop the strategies that make it possible for them to create specialized organs, isolate the interior of their body from the environment, and to maintain that interior environment as they haul themselves out of the sea and colonize the continents.</p>

<p>We watched three seeding operations, all of which proceeded similarly although they involved very different biochemical agents and were run by different specialist groups.  The last world we visited had large areas of green on its continents, but these turned out to be forests of giant fungi which were devoid of animal life, and the atmosphere was nearly thirty percent oxygen.</p>

<p>"Usually the oxygen load will spur development of animal life to make use of it, but for some reason that hasn't happened here.  We will have to give it a kick or this ecosystem will burn itself out.  If we can we use viruses to give existing organisms extra capabilities which can be enhanced by natural selection, but in a case like this we may have to resort to introducing entire families of library organisms to mitigate the developing crisis.  Life manages to do amazing things on its own but it also manages to paint itself into corners with depressing frequency."</p>

<p>At some point one of the scientists told us that their records showed that world CI:1742660, known to its inhabitants as Earth, had not developed its Cambrian Explosion spontaneously.  It had been seeded to give advanced life a chance to develop before the Sun made it uninhabitable, a transition they expected in about a billion Earth years.  With the aging cure it was not out of the question that Emma and I could live to see that happen.</p>

<p>When we returned to Earth the giant fold ship <em>Alexei Leonov</em> had taken on its load of fold drive manuals, scientists, and tourists and had been replaced at the loading terminal by the <em>Rocinante</em>.  That ship was scheduled to finish loading within eight months, at which point the publishing operation would be shuttered and the whole enterprise would consist of the three ships exploring the galaxy.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to be going fine without us so we folded over to the last Curator asteroid station we would visit.  Unlike the others, this one was not unique; there were three similar stations doing the same duty of curating worlds from the earliest land-based life toward a species capable of taking the Critical Path.</p>

<p>"We have about twelve million worlds in our index," this leader said.  "When we first get them from the last crew you visited, we visit them once every few million years.  As life becomes more complex it also becomes likely to undergo more rapid change, and we find that if we visit less than every quarter million or so of your years we miss important transitions.  Those fellows often have to seed worlds because they simply don't develop, but once life reaches <em>this</em> point it does nothing <em>but</em> develop.  Our biggest problem is when it develops into a dead end that won't lead to the Critical Path."</p>

<p>This time there was no clean progression from simple to complex worlds.  "At this point you can't look at the life forms of an ecosystem and tell how long it's been developing or how 'far along' it is toward our goal for it," we were told.  "Forms ebb and flow in ways we still can't model predictably.  We have had worlds transition to the Critical Path in as little as thirty million years after we took over their index, and some of those with no intervention at all on our part.  We've had others that simply never developed, despite repeated interventions to correct dead ends, and which we eventually abandoned because their stars were becoming too old."</p>

<p>"What exactly do you mean by a dead end?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"Your own world provides a perfect example.  CI:1742660 developed a healthy ecosystem within a reasonable span after we got it, but then it spiraled into an arms race between ever larger predators and prey.  We gave it nearly a hundred million years but it only ever got worse, and sixty-five million years ago we corrected the situation.  That was obviously the right course of action because you fellows developed as a result."</p>

<p>"Except someone didn't think we were worth developing later," I said.</p>

<p>"You have to talk to the Critical Path agents about that.  I would say that your presence here today proves they were wrong."</p>

<p>"Considering that you guys seeded the galaxy with life, the idea that you could be that wrong about something is a little terrifying," Emma said.</p>

<p>The leader made a tinny clicking noise which our implants identified as laughter.  "The Universe is inherently chaotic," he said, then he looked thoughtful, and said "and I mean that in your technical sense, not your vernacular sense.  The quality you call omniscience is simply impossible.  There is no state of existence so advanced that one becomes incapable of misunderstanding a situation or making a mistake.  We are proof of that, and we have only made a garden of one galaxy."</p>

<p>"We often wonder why the Curators never expanded beyond the Milky Way."</p>

<p>"Our estimates of the natural rate of development of advanced life suggest to us that this galaxy now contains more advanced life than the rest of the universe.  Why would we need more?"</p>

<p>It turned out that other than breaking up the logjams of "dead end evolution," this crew really didn't do much with the worlds under its watch except to turn them over to the Critical Path agents when something promising emerged.  That doesn't happen very often so we didn't get to see any examples, but we did get to see a world marked for a cleansing correction.</p>

<p>"Worlds where all the continental land masses are connected are a problem, especially when all those land masses are tropical in climate.  I wanted to show you this world because it is very similar to yours when we intervened.  There are both predator and prey animals massing over a hundred thousand kilograms.  They are very highly specialized and unlikely to develop intelligence, and their presence makes life perilous for any other life form that might show the kind of promise that we want.  One way or another they have to go."</p>

<p>The monsters of this world strongly resembled dinosaurs, except that they had scales instead of feathers and beaks instead of jaws and teeth.  Imagine a forty foot tall hundred thousand kilogram carnivorous parrot.  The herbivores had appropriate defenses that made them impregnable to smaller predators, and even the trees were enormous to keep from being completely devoured by the giant herbivores.  There were few niches where smaller animals could thrive and none stable enough to allow for Critical Path development.</p>

<p>"We're not going to make the correction now, because we have to monitor it for awhile when we do.  But within a million years or so we will return for one final survey, and barring a miracle we will throw a rock at them."</p>

<p>"How would you do it?" I asked.</p>

<p>The leader activated a display.  "We pick a suitable rock, usually a moonlet of a gas giant since those are easiest to find.  The limit for fold amplifier belts is about twenty kilometers diameter.  We look for a suitable impact point on the target world.  We want ocean shallows so that we can create a tsunami, as well as sulfate minerals if possible to create toxic rain.  Equatorial so that both the north and south hemispheres will be affected equally.  We wait until the rock's existing orbital motion is aiming it at the right angle, and fold it to within about a thousand kilometers of the target, to give our delivering agent time to fold out before it strikes."</p>

<p>"One of our paleontologists once said that the Earth's K-T impactor couldn't have landed in a worse possible place," I said.  "That wasn't by accident, was it?"</p>

<p>"Of course not.  Life is surprisingly resilient and we need to be sure the reset is complete.  Life at this stage always comes back, but we need it to come back without the giant monsters dominating the ecosystem."</p>

<p>Later in our quarters Emma was pensive.  "Within a thousand kilometers," she said with a heavy sigh.  "It's not even sporting.  It's an assassination."</p>

<p>"They're in the way though," I said.  "And it's not our garden, really."</p>

<p>"Not everything is in the way," she said.  "To get rid of the monsters they kill nearly everything.  Nearly every individual of every species, enough that a lot of the smaller species will have no surviving individuals either.  Isn't that counterproductive?"</p>

<p>When we brought it up to the mission leader, he made a gesture our implants recognized as a shrug.  "We tend a lot of worlds," he said.  "We don't have time to be more surgical about it.  We've been doing it this way for aeons."</p>

<p>"Look, the world we just visited, you're pretty sure it's going to need a reset, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, yes.  When we carry it out we'll also probably spend several months watching the outcome which distracts us from the rest of our mission, but it has to be done."</p>

<p>"And you don't really want to wipe out everything, right?  If you <em>could</em> do it surgically, what would the thresholds be?"</p>

<p>"Well we're most concerned with both predator and prey animals that mass more than ten thousand kilograms.  Intelligent species with primitive weapons can deal with animals of that scale, as your own ancestors did, but they can't deal with animals that mass a hundred thousand kilograms."</p>

<p>"Would you mind if we humans took a stab at this problem for you?  I think we might have a way to do it that leaves the smaller animals and the overall ecosystem much more intact."</p>

<p>"That would be an interesting experiment.  I would certainly see no reason not to let you proceed with such a plan, since we could always go ahead with our method if necessary.  What exactly will you be doing?"</p>

<p>"Let's keep in touch," Emma said.  "I have to talk to some of our human ... friends."</p>

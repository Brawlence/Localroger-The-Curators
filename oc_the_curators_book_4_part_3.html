<p>A couple of days later we were all pretty much just staring at the sphere trying to think of something else to do to it when Callie said, "Why would this thing even need a user interface?"</p>

<p>"You don't want it blowing you up.  How do you tell it to arm itself?"</p>

<p>She looked at me.  "Your informant said that the new units would fly themselves, but these ones are prototypes.  They don't fly themselves.  They snuck the one that destroyed Terminus onto a ship, didn't they?"</p>

<p>"The <em>Boardwalk Empire.</em>"</p>

<p>"In a shipping container?"</p>

<p>"We have no way to know."</p>

<p>"On the vacuum skirt, maybe?"</p>

<p>One of the Agency techs said, "But you still have to target..."</p>

<p>"It's a fold engine.  It needs a nearby planet and a nearby star.  Then instead of folding them together..."</p>

<p>The next day we were watching it through the glass dome of a small bell jar as a vacuum pump worked.  As the pressure dropped to about three millibars one of our meters beeped.</p>

<p>"It's powered up," one of the techs said.</p>

<p>"Still no sign of the usual user interface," I added.  Callie checked her instruments and nodded.</p>

<p>"Well now what?"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't want it to just activate on vacuum exposure, because it would blow up the world it was leaving from," Callie said.  "There must be a secondary trigger."</p>

<p>"Folding," I said.  "Now it's powered up, but it's not scanning or reacting to anything.  It could detect an external fold in this state though.  And after the first fold, there's no planet or star nearby until you reach your destination."</p>

<p>"That could be a bit hard to check here with the inhibitor running," one of the Agency techs said.</p>

<p>I closed the petcock on the bell jar and disconnected the vacuum line.  "I have an amplifier," I said.  "I can overcome the inhibitor for short range."</p>

<p>"How short a range?" one of the other Agency guys asked.</p>

<p>"Far enough," I said.  I walked to the far side of the lab, about ten meters away, and folded back to the test table.  I could feel the huge effort the amplifier had to exert to make that happen.  I put the bell jar down on the table.</p>

<p>There was an alarm.  "Fold activity!  Centered here, aperture twenty-one hundred meters, range one AU...  Snuffed by the inhibitor."  The alarm went off, then eight seconds later it came on again.</p>

<p>"Son of a bitch," the lead tech said.</p>

<p>I opened the petcock to release the vacuum.  The fold alarm went off again.  "Trigger's been pulled," I said.  "No reset."  It went off, and went off again, and went off again.  I opened the bell jar, hefted the ball, and threw it at the far tile wall of the lab with a healthy bit of microfold supergravity acceleration to help it along.  It made a respectable hole in the tile and shattered into a thousand pieces.</p>

<p>"No more fold activity," the tech said somewhat anticlimactically.  "Well that stopped it, but now we can't study it any more," he added.</p>

<p>"We've learned what we needed to know from it," I said.  "There's no user interface to manipulate and no meaningful automation.  Most human worlds will reject the fold attempt due to the changes I made in their defense systems after Terminus.  But there are a million worlds in this galaxy with no fold defenses, and we have no idea what the remnant Plasma might be planning."</p>

<p>"But it's humans they have a jones on, and all <em>our</em> worlds are protected."</p>

<p>"One thing about Curators is they are not afraid to think on very long time scales, and an Earth millennium is not a long time for them.  Eventually we will get tired of the paranoid anti-fold measures.  They could just be planning to wait until we get complacent, which being human we probably will.  We still need to find the others and destroy them."</p>

<hr />

<p>Three weeks after we tested the Curator weapon the Red Prince turned up inside my apartment when I got home from the lab.</p>

<p>"I thought you were at the Pinwheel," I said ignoring the fact that he had also broken into my home.</p>

<p>"I was, until I heard you captured a weapon like the one that destroyed Terminus."</p>

<p>"If by 'captured' you mean 'was given.'"</p>

<p>"And what's the disposition of your benefactor?"</p>

<p>"Planning to stay on Earth, which is probably a good idea.  Whoever finally tries to kill it will get a surprise."</p>

<p>"And what did you learn from it?"</p>

<p>"You ask that as if you already know the answer."</p>

<p>"Humor me."</p>

<p>"It was very minimalist.  I think it was the first new design in a very long time by someone who was very uncertain of how the tools worked."</p>

<p>"That's the consensus among my people too.  There is something you need to know, which I can't tell you here."</p>

<p>"We can go to the Center..."</p>

<p>"By 'here' I mean 'on Earth.'  I have a ship ready.  You should arrange to be gone for awhile."</p>

<p>Coming from most people this would sound very menacing, but I knew Red would not be acting like this if there wasn't something terribly important afoot.  We took an aircar to his ship, which was an ultrafast Gateway picket.  Except that when we left Earth we didn't head toward the Gateway station.</p>

<p>"We know where the manufactory was," he finally told me when we were far enough away and going too fast for spy equipment to work.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Shortly after Callie blew it I sent an expedition out there with big-ass optical telescopes.  You remember light, that stuff that doesn't travel instantaneousy?  Well there's a spherical shell of it crawling outward from the scene of the crime.  We knew about where it was from Callie's rescue system logs to within a few light-years, and we were out there within a couple of years looking for the shell.  When we found it we were able to fold here and there and pin down the location of the star and the nature of the event with great precision."</p>

<p>"Wait, you've known where the manufactory was for over <em>six hundred years</em> and you haven't told anybody?"</p>

<p>"We don't want the Curators to know either that we know <em>or</em> where it is.  By <em>any</em> channel."</p>

<p>"But surely there's nothing left."</p>

<p>"We're not so sure.  We've been thinking about staging a return but we didn't want to risk blowing our secret unnecessarily.  This thing with the weapon has made up my mind.  They were doing new stuff, and some of the tools might have been elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Why would they be?  The Curators put everything in portable stations.  The swarm of assembly stations was classic..."</p>

<p>"Refer to Callie's memory," Red said, and he beamed it to my implant.  She had been watching the planet for hours, and as the explosion began lights on the surface of the world all seemed to go out at once, presumably as seismic effects disrupted their infrastructure.</p>

<p>"Have you ever known the Curators to put critical infrastructure on the surface of <em>anything?</em>" Red asked.</p>

<p>"No, but this was billions..."</p>

<p>"And they seem to have been learning to use it from scratch, uncertainly and without guidance."</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"We think it was built by their Ancestors."</p>

<p>I thought about this for a moment.  "So what?" I finally said.  "Nothing that was anywhere near that world is made of solid matter any more.  She put enough energy into it to vaporize everything around by three orders of magnitude."</p>

<p>"The other thing Curators don't do is put stuff on the surface of <em>other worlds</em> than the ones they find interesting.  But if this was done by the Ancestors, there might be remnant infrastructure on the other worlds of the neutron star system.  Remember, even the Curators say the Ancestors were a lot like <em>us</em>."</p>

<p>"How do you know the Curators haven't already gone back?  Why wouldn't they?"</p>

<p>Red grinned ferociously.  "Because they fucking <em>can't</em>.  We used <em>telescopes</em>.  And other detectors.  And remember, the Curators' children don't build anything that they can't build with nanites, and you can't build a curved optical glass surface with nanites.  And the Curators don't build any kind of detector tech that doesn't involve the fold.  You guys met under that big-ass telescope in Hawai'i for a hundred years because it was the biggest telescope in the galaxy, but what you didn't realize was that even if the only telescope humans had ever built was a thirty-centimeter reflector you ground in your back yard, <em>that</em> would still be the biggest telescope in the galaxy.  Nobody else in the galaxy <em>does</em> telescopes, or photoscopes, or astronomical spectrographs, or gravity wave detectors, because they've all got the 'build it with nanites and go there with the fold' mentality.  And if you can't go there or detect it with the fold, they don't think it's worth bothering with.  It's why we have a better idea how long it's been since the Big Bang than the Curators do."</p>

<p>"Wait, what?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, long story.  Anyway we don't want too many people to know what we're up to because if the Curators <em>did</em> know about it they would almost certainly lose their shit in a dangerously unpredictable way."</p>

<p>"I have to honestly say I can't disagree with that."</p>

<p>"Exactly.  But we need your insight.  You are the only one of long Curator heritage we can trust with this.  And yes, there might be nothing left for us to find.  Even probably.  But the chance is worth a bit of effort, and we need to do it before others realize the same thing."</p>

<p>"It sounds like even if they did realize it they wouldn't have our ... well your resources for pursuing it."</p>

<p>"They wouldn't, if not for the possibility of special intelligence.  We know they put spies all through our civilization as we were colonizing the Pinwheel.  We only trust those we know were active and trustworthy before the first attempted attack on Terminus, when you relieved that poor kid Thomas of his implant."</p>

<p>That did amount to a lot of people because after humans took over the regulation of interstellar trade in the Milky Way they started giving every living human being the mortality Cure.  Fortunately the human itch to explore and expand was keeping the human population of Earth and the Milky Way stable as we moved outward to other galaxies, and DENT technology was keeping everyone comfortable even as the total human population of the Universe neared one trillion.</p>

<p>Red's fast picket was not going to Gateway because he also had his own large fold ship stationed out beyond the defense perimeter in an entirely different direction.  After we rendezvoused the fold ship, which would have been considered giant before the great ships of the Pinwheel diaspora were built, it took a few hundred of us back to the place where Callie had saved the galaxy.</p>

<p>While the rover continued checking its systems Red and I retreated to the far side of the ship because we weren't sure how sensitive its pickups might be or how quickly it might learn.</p>

<p>"We need to put it to sleep again while we figure out where to go from here," he said.</p>

<p>"I know, but we need another pretext because it's obviously very observant and intelligent."</p>

<p>"We could just have an accidental power interruption."</p>

<p>"Maybe, but that's a well I think we can only go to once."</p>

<p>"I think I have an idea."</p>

<p>We returned to the test room and the rover clacked that its systems all tested nominal.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>Can you tell how close our voltage supply is to what you would normally use?</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>It is at eighty-two percent of what the reactor would normally put out, but that is suitable.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>Now that we know the optimum rating we'd like to arrange a simpler and more robust supply designed for that voltage.  We might even be able to make a portable arrangement.  Can you carry a load on your back?</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>Yes, I was designed to transport artifacts when necessary, and I can carry one and one half times my own mass including the reactor as a payload.  That is another reason my instruments are on the bottom of my body.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>Before we disconnect again, I was wondering if there is a way of backing up or reloading your thought matrix from an external storage.  If you don't object we would like to try building another platform to emulate your thought matrix.  It would be a big head start for us to not need a scan of one of our own people.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>That was an issue in the early days of our own technology.  There is a theory that a matrix image could be constructed over time by scanning a living brain's electrical activity, but nobody had figured out how to pack enough sensors into a living brain when my mission launched.</em></p>

<p>"That makes a lot of sense," I said to Red in English. "That's how the implant method works, with the microfold."</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>We obviously have a means of loading and exporting the thought matrix from machines like this one.  You will need a proper interface though.</em></p>

<p>It fired up the projector and started another technical slide show.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>This is the communication protocol for our control interface.  It allows our developers to take control and perform maintenance functions on machines like myself.  You will need to implement a terminal, and a communications transceiver for one of the specified frequencies and modulation methods.</em></p>

<p>About sixty pages flashed by.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>And this is the protocol for the backup file bitstream.  You would not need to know it to receive my backup and import it to another machine, but you will need it to build a machine capable of taking the import.</em></p>

<p>"This is going to put us ahead five hundred years," Red said.</p>

<p>"At least."</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>To activate the interface you will need a pass code.  It is not on the documents, but here it is:</em></p>

<p>It used clacky Common to tell us a string of numbers.  The format seemed oddly familiar.  I engaged my implant and realized that one of the methods I had been offered when I uplifted Jay and Emma had been <strong>LEGACY</strong>.  </p>

<p>I recalled the control interface, made this selection, and was suddenly aware that there was one compatible machine within range.  I sent the code to it and became aware of a maintenance menu.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>That was fast.  You have made contact.</em></p>

<p>This was similar to the interface I had used to direct Jay's and Emma's implants to associate with their bodies, but it had different options.  To contact their implants I needed a special code created from the serial number of the implant, useful only for that implant and only for one use.  This was a general-purpose interface, like the one Jay had remembered after he returned from emulation.  Only this interface had options like <strong>EXPORT</strong> and, in this case present but unselectable, <strong>CLEAR</strong> and <strong>IMPORT</strong>.  I chose <strong>EXPORT</strong>.</p>

<p>My own implant made me wonder what to do with the data.  Curators generally integrate thought data they receive into their own implant-extended conscious awareness but now I was aware that there was another option, because this was an import method we don't normally have access to, to put it in non-conscious general storage.  I was aware that the file would be well within my capacity to save so I started the operation.  I became aware that it would take about 2<sup>10</sup> ticks to complete.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>You've started the upload, are you receiving it?</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>Yes.</em></p>

<p>"What the hell is going on?" Red asked.  All of this had been invisible to him, happening within my head and over radio.</p>

<p>"There's a legacy communication mode supported by my implant.  Nobody knew what it was for.  Until now."  And I pointed at the rover.</p>

<p>"So the Curators don't use radio, but their Ancestors did."</p>

<p>"And the protocols are still the same."</p>

<p>We made small talk until the transfer was complete, and let the rover fold its instruments and limbs up and shut down so we could cycle its power.</p>

<p>We would power it up again with a portable battery pack, which would also give us a plausible reason to shut it down more often as necessary for recharging.  But even that wouldn't happen for four years.</p>

<hr />

<p>There were about thirty research team members aboard Red's fold ship.  I faced them before an electronic white board showing a diagram of several layers of functionality.  </p>

<p>I pointed to the top square.  "These are the things all Curators can do," I said.  "Navigation, fold travel, automated taking of a new host, automated burning of current bioform to deliberately move to emulation.  Extended memory, mostly of the lives of previous hosts, and a bit of mild generalized superintelligence.  These are the <em>only</em> functions available to most Curators."</p>

<p>I pointed to the next level, which had several boxes.  "These are things only some Curators can do.  Prepping an implant for uplift of a non-Curator bioform.  Summoning an amplifier.  Some maintenance functions.  Navigation to the Manufactory.  Some other functions related to Curation of worlds and species.  These are unlocked on an as-needed basis and access is guarded by groups that have evolved around that need for access, offering both temporary access and membership according to need and trust."</p>

<p>I pointed to the next level.  "These are things that Curators aren't supposed to be able to do at all, but can in a special situation.  I think access to these was mediated by the Manufactory.  But there was a back door, which Jay became aware of after his period of emergency induced emulation.  These functions are extremely dangerous but for the most part they do maintain the Curator taboos about multiple instances of a single personality."  </p>

<p>Then I pointed to the bottom level.  "These functions were created by the Ancestors.  They're the <em>real</em> maintenance mode of a thought matrix machine, and in our rover friend they are simply hidden behind a single common pass code known to any engineers who might have a reason for access.  There is also some secondary protection; you can't trigger an import unless the device has been cleared, and you can't clear a device with a functioning personality unless it unlocks itself.  There is apparently even a backdoor for <em>that</em>, but it requires physical access."</p>

<p>"These functions <em>don't</em> enforce the Curator taboo, as the Ancestors were in the habit of reusing thought matrix images.  Those were expensive and precious, since they had to kill the donor to get one.  Before we shut it down I exported the rover's thought matrix, and since then our comms team has successfully emulated the comm protocol and received it from my implant in legacy radio mode.  And with that it's their turn."</p>

<p>The lead emulation researcher took the podium.  "It's a little strange to be standing here with something to actually tell you after all these centuries," she said.  "We were already deep into that thought matrix diagram the rover gave us when Andrew showed up with this file and specification.  Not surprisingly, there is a very close relationship between the two.  The Ancestors understood, or at least believed they understood, exactly how consciousness and thought worked.  This implementation displays a high degree of maturity and certainty about its function."</p>

<p>She clicked through a few slides.  "According to this model a consciousness is an interaction between two functional sheets of computation arranged in a fractal arrangement of self-similar zones.  One functional sheet, implemented by the cerebral cortex in humans, performs storage.  The other, implemented within the thalamus, performs pattern detection and sharpening.  Storage is implemented in a biological brain by growing processes and in the model by creating and strengthening numerical relationships.  Sharpening is implemented by testing the stored patterns for their similarity to patterns at higher and lower levels of fractal distance from the motor and sensory areas, where sharpening elements -- in the thalamus in humans -- are directly connected to sensory inputs and motor outputs.  Very generally, sensations are received and sharpened according to previous experience until they trigger or, according to emotional feedback, create new pattern detectors."</p>

<p>More slides.  "In the most abstract zones patterns of general situational awareness are tested against changes that the consciousness might make in its environment, and whether those changes would likely result in a new reality that is beneficial or should be avoided.  These desired situational modifications filter through ever less abstract areas being sharpened toward what is situationally possible until they are presented to the motor zones as specific actions to be taken by motor effectors or, in a living being, muscles."</p>

<p>More slides.  "We are already working on a platform to try running this emulation, but there's something else.  All of the process markers are tagged.  Those that were in the original emulation which was uploaded to the rover when it was made are tagged with both their original and current working values.  In some cases the current values are zero, which we think would correspond to cell death or complete synapse erosion in a biological brain, but there is evidence that connections are never completely forgotten in the model.  Processes and pattern nodes which didn't exist at all in the original are marked separately."</p>

<p>More slides.  "And some groups have been deliberately disabled.  They were apparently present in the original thought matrix scan of the biological donor, but while they are preserved here do not contribute to the functioning model.  Our rover friend said its makers edited away those things which would make it less productive, but it seems they didn't <em>delete</em> them.  And there's more.</p>

<p>A single slide.  "There are comments, in a recognizable variant of modern encoded Common.  This one says 'disables varous impressions of natural environments.'"</p>

<p>There was a chorus of little gasps throughout the room.  "Yes, they went there."  Another slide.  "This one says 'disables sexual attraction."  Another slide.  'Disables memories of mate and children.'"</p>

<p>"There are tens of thousands of these tags, each marking a group of edits.  We believe the edits were made with the help of the emulated consciousness itself, probably by an extensive team.  Preparing our friend to live in its rover body was a major project."</p>

<p>"That's horrible," someone in the audience said.</p>

<p>The researcher shrugged.  "That might be a matter of culture.  The Ancestors clearly weren't killing people left and right to get their thought matrices, and our rover's donor obviously didn't feel it was being violated in the process.  But if I can give this back to Andrew, it opens up a new possibility that might, well, I'll let him tell you."</p>

<p>I took the podium again.  "We appear to have the entire original scan, and detailed reasons for the edits that were made.  While we will obviously want to develop our own machines to make use of this data, we <em>already have</em> a few machines that can do that."  I tapped my head.  "I uploaded this from the rover with my Curator implant, and another implant should be capable of receiving the file through that same Ancestral maintenance menu the Curators don't know about.  Emulation doesn't do much good though since the Curators' design prevents the implant from interacting much with the natural world when it is in emulation.  But it <em>would</em> allow for the thought matrix to take a bioform host."</p>

<p>"You mean a child?" someone asked.</p>

<p>I nodded.  "Sixty thousand years ago I was brought to Earth as an implant which had lost its previous bioform host, and that implant linked itself to a human child which would have died if it had not been rescued by my handlers.  Over a course of years the implant synchronized the human child's bioform brain with the implant engrams and I became a human with the memories and abilities of a Curator."</p>

<p>"I think most humans would be pretty outraged by that," someone else said.  "Your life was saved, but you're no longer your human parents' child.  Why on Earth would we allow such a thing?"</p>

<p>"Because of the edits to make a machine body tolerable to it, the rover does not remember its life as an Ancestor," I said.  "But if its original unedited biological thought matrix were synchronized to an appropriate bioform, then like me that being would remember everything."</p>

<p>The sunlight on 208 Lincoln hurt.</p>

<p>The gravity was okay, because part of the DENT terraforming of my homeworld Va'arna had been a gravity correction to the Earth standard, but the light from our star was dim and we depended on artifical lights to make it bright enough to see comfortably even outdoors.  But Lincoln was an actual Earthlike world which had required minimal DENT patching to make it habitable.  The sunlight was vicious and I had been warned that it would even be dangerous if I was to look directly at the sun, or spend too much time exposed to it.</p>

<p>On Lincoln I crossed an ocean on a sidewheel steamship modeled from an CE 1870 Earth design.  The challenge was to actually wait the voyage out without using our implants to cheat.  It took almost two weeks and there was an encounter with a storm which would have been terrifying if we hadn't all had implants to fall back on in case of catastrophe.  But along with the other hundred passengers I learned what humans had had to experience for our species to ascend from the status of pets or animals to that of rulers of the Universe.</p>

<p>I rode with game hunters who tracked and killed an animal far larger and more dangerous than anything I had ever seen, such things having never being introduced on worlds like Va'arna.  The hunters claimed the meat was sweeter than anything available elsewhere, but I honestly couldn't tell the difference between what they served me after the hunt and what the nanites made back home.</p>

<p>I spent a day at the beach and found out they were right about the dangers of sunlight.  It was worth it though to let the incredible waves that rolled in from a world-girdling ocean wash over me.</p>

<p>Galaxy 208 is considered anomalous.  It is a dwarf galaxy of only about five million stars, but unlike most dwarf galaxies its size it has high metallicity, so its suns and their worlds can support life and the infrastructure of nanite technology.  It's thought that 208 is a remnant ripped from a larger galaxy in a collision aeons ago.  It might not have been settled except that an ordinary optical telescope survey from the world 166 Tobago suggested that exploration might be merited.</p>

<p>Only five somewhat Earthlike worlds like Lincoln have been found in galaxy 208.  And of course all of those lack at least one element of the Curator formula for long-term habitability.  In particular none of them has a stabilizing moon.  All five have had discussions about correcting that, but none have moved on such plans yet.</p>

<p>The Prometheans of 208 Deucalion treated me to a sublight tour of their solar system in one of their trademark glass ships.  It took three weeks and I became good friends with the other six Promethean tourists on board.  </p>

<p>Then the galaxy shuttle finally arrived.</p>

<hr />

<p>Everyone was insistent that the Promethean fold ship <em>Meritorious Intent</em> was on the small size for its function, but it was by at least an order of magnitude the largest artificially created artifact I had ever encountered -- unless, as some people insist, you count DENT terraformed worlds.  But I had grown up on a DENT world, and the <em>Intent</em> was a much different thing.</p>

<p>The <em>Intent</em> was a sphere over a hundred meters in diameter with decks slicing it into forty levels.  There was a central atrium and at the center of this hollow space the fold drive, a Promethean glass drive over two meters in diameter, was suspended by massive glass columns.  It emitted bright flashing light as it operated and this was especially bothersome on decks fifteen through twenty-five, so those were mostly devoted to Promethean life systems which maintained the environment.  I was assigned a hammock berth on deck six, and since I was human they thoughtfully provided me with a privacy curtain.  The shower and bodily waste facilities on that deck were also provided with privacy curtains mainly because of my presence.  The Prometheans don't often have humans as passengers on their ships but they try to provide for our neuroses when they do.</p>

<p>In order to keep me away from the constantly flashing fold drive my hammock was nearly up against the outer glass hull, and I could arrange the curtain to provide an outside view while shielding myself from the flashing drive.  Unfortunately, in intergalactic space there isn't much to see with merely normal vision.  The stars of galaxy 208 receded to invisibility with shocking suddenness once we were under way and there wasn't much to see through the spectacular transparent hull until we reached the Milky Way four months later.</p>

<p>On the <em>Intent</em> we observed a standard Promethean day of a little over 27 hours.  208 Deucalion used this same clock so I was already used to it.  Over the course of the journey I toured the ecosystem facilities that were keeping us alive and also the bridge in the basement where the ship controls were located.  After I boggled at the gas discharge info displays the Captain admitted they had human engineered tablet controls that were much more sophisticated and simpler to operate, but because they would have no control if they became dependent and those should fail they had a habit of using their own basic controls all the time.  They said this is an idea they had adopted from humans, because we had done the same thing during the years after we invented submarines when that technology was still primitive.</p>

<p>On the <em>Intent</em> we ate real food because there were no nanite constructors for similar reasons.  Our diet was mostly vegetarian because there were no large animals in the ship ecosystem, but we did occasionally have something small and gamey.  As was the case with humans there were a few Promethean passengers who stayed away from those meals.</p>

<p>There were about two hundred Promethean passengers, a mix of professionals returning home after performing jobs at 208 Deucalion and natives making the pilgrimage to meet distantly related family and visit legendary landmarks.  Nearly everyone could trace their ancestry to someone who worked on the project to create their original fold drive during the decades when Jay and Emma were teaching them how to make their own technology.</p>

<p>When the ship reached Prometheus I found lodging near the spaceport, then because I didn't have local coordinates for folding I took an aircar to the nearby capital where the Bank of Earth was located.</p>

<hr />

<p>"I have to admit that <em>this</em> is something that doesn't happen every day," the human clerk said as he examined my key.</p>

<p>"Is there any problem?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, it's ours.  There are a handful of boxes that have been rented and not accessed for this long.  The owner made a lump sum payment for rental in perpetuity forty-seven thousand years ago.  We thought that lump sum extravagantly expensive back in the day but nobody had really thought out what "in perpetuity" could mean after the mortality Cure.  Turns out he got quite a bargain.  Accessed it exactly once after renting it and never came back."</p>

<p>"I can't imagine what is in it."</p>

<p>"You'll have to imagine for a little longer.  There's a condition attached to access.  You have to provide a genetic sample and show at least a one-quarter match to the person who rented the box."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"You have to be either our original customer or a son or grandson, brother or half-brother, or first cousin.  Or his father or grandfather, but since this had to be one of the first humans ever to take the Cure in order to be around to be so closely related to someone your age, that would seem unlikely."</p>

<p>I let them take the sample and came back after an hour.</p>

<p>"So how did I do?"</p>

<p>The clerk held out his hand for the key.  "You're our customer's son," he said.</p>

<p><em>My Child</em>, the note had begun.</p>

<p>He unlocked the box and brought me to a privacy cubicle to open it.  Inside was a stunning item of jewelry and a mysterious note printed on some kind of plastic material.</p>

<p><em>Reward awaits the being who returns this to its rightful owner</em>, the note read.  And a set of galactic position coordinates.</p>

<p>The plastic disintegrated when I touched it, but fortunately I had recorded the message with my implant.  I took the pendant and its simple chain and pocketed it.  Before leaving the bank I told the clerk they could close out the box as it was no longer needed.</p>

<p>Then I went to find a jeweler.</p>

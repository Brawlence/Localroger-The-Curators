<p>We lost Miami before we had a chance to save it.  While the <em>Laputa</em> was in early construction, hurricane Wilson came across Florida's peninsula and drove a five meter storm surge into the vulnerable city.  The residential suburbs were annihilated.  The city persisted as a set of tall buildings with flooded basements in the old downtown, some of which were originally residential and others of which were quickly converted.  But the evacuation had not gone well and the death toll had finally dwarfed that of the Galveston hurricane of 1900.  The sea was coming for many of Man's works, and Man was finally ready to take notice.</p>

<p>Wilson had re-strengthened after crossing Florida and made a beeline for New Orleans.  There the evacuation went better, and the massive stormworks erected in the decades after Katrina did their job, if only by inches.  Many of the Wilson survivors of both Miami and New Orleans never came back.</p>

<p>Two years later <em>Laputa</em> was in space trials and a furious debate was going on in Congress.  Officially the human-alien program was international, but as a practical matter it was Americans who built the fold and supergravity drives and so my leaders dominated the conversation.  I was officially retired, but my wife had been drafted to be chief test pilot for the <em>Laputa</em> and I had of course brokered the <em>Pax Kattegat</em>.  And we had taken one of the first nanite-built houses offered in Newer Orleans, leading the necessary exodus of our homeworld.</p>

<p>The sea was also coming for a hundred other human cities.  It was flooding the understory of lower Manhattan every few years, and since preventing the seawater incursion had proven impossible drastic measures had been taken to make the underground recoverable in the aftermath, with everything except the subway tracks moved above the floodline where possible.  Flood insurance had become impossible to obtain for anything on a barrier island or beach anywhere in the world, and millions of dwellings were either snapped up by the wealthy or abandoned depending on their circumstances.</p>

<p>When <em>Laputa</em> landed in Newfoundland it was an event of galactic importance.  It was the largest starship ever to make landfall in all the billions of years the galaxy had been gardened by the Curators.  The Hyacinth actually waited for us to land <em>Laputa</em> before attempting to do the same with their twin ship.  Nothing like trusting the other guys' engineering.</p>

<p>Then the decision was made that the city to evacuate first had to be New Orleans, but you couldn't land such a massive thing on the soft swampland surrounding the city.  It was M who noted that the supergravity drive used the same amount of energy no matter what its field radius was, so it took only the charge from a couple of car batteries to levitate the ship for weeks at a time.  So like an object out of an Arthur C. Clarke novel the <em>Laputa</em> appeared above the swamp south of New Orleans, and floating vehicles began what would become the largest planetary evacuation in galactic history.</p>

<p>The <em>Laputa</em> would be joined within ten years by the <em>Pandora</em> and the <em>Galactica</em>.  We built a new facility for making fold drives and recruited five more species to help us building offworld cities.  It took twenty years but we managed to move half our population offworld without any more catastrophes like Miami, even though Earth's seas continued to rise and their storms became ever stronger and more frequent.</p>

<p>The Consortium which the Hyacinth had started eventually became pretty proficient at making supergravity drives, although their yield never got better than eighty percent or so while ours on earth was over ninety-nine percent.  While we evacuated the Earth it became apparent over the microfold that all over the galaxy, worlds were taking a wait-and-see attitude before starting new capital fold ship projects.  With the demonstration of <em>Laputa</em> and the understanding that something the size of a baseball made it possible to land such a thing instead of keeping it in orbit, nobody wanted to waste the resources making an old style fold ship if they weren't sure it wouldn't soon be obsolete.</p>

<p>Out in the galaxy the economic value of human-made fold drives, which were a hundred times harder to make than supergravity drives, wasn't based on their small size; it was their nearly perfect calibration, which made it possible to fold across the galaxy in a single operation and actually arrive at your target.  This was a fortunate thing because we had a lot of cities to build on our colonies fast and many species were eager to trade resources to get one of those drives.  And while the cities they built all incorporated human architectural motifs they also all brought in a bit of their own, so the colony worlds took on personalities according to both the human source culture and the aliens who had helped us build them.  It made for more of a tourist industry than we had ever expected to sustain, and it was the small Earth fold ships still the size of airliners that made that trade possible.</p>

<p>And the Witness serum had all but eliminated human death.  There were still tragic exceptions, but they were tragic <em>because</em> they were exceptions.  There had been some discussion of keeping the serum secret or limiting its distribution, but some person whose initial might have been M or J might have had something to do with publicizing its existence.  In previous circumstances it might have devastated the foundations of our economy, but in the midst of the planetary evacuation it made no real difference regarding anything except that people who would have died continued to live.</p>

<p>But the Witness serum had its limits, and futures were trading higher in the tattered remnants of the human funeral industry as we all got older.  Forty years later, as I marked my ninetieth birthday, my doctor showed me a graph.  "I want you to see this first," he said.  "This is my response to the collagen cross-linking test since I took the serum."  It rose gradually across the decades, signaling that there were some things the serum couldn't fix.</p>

<p>"Now you may have been wondering why you and, I suppose M, look so young.  This is yours."  The same graph started flat and stayed flat, not rising a pixel across decades of sampling.</p>

<p>"So what does that mean?"</p>

<p>"It means something is fixing your collagen.  As far as we know nothing can <em>stop</em> it from cross-linking.  That would be a breakthrough."</p>

<p>"That's very funny," I said.</p>

<p>"There's nothing funny about it.  You might want to come clean with us about what else was done to you."</p>

<p>When I got home M and our human-form Curator friend were waiting.  "You're busted," the Curator said.  "You need to get back to the Witnesses before your own people get to you.  There is a ship in orbit about to debark, and I can get you there before anyone knows.  Unfortunately I don't have the amplifier belt, so I can't get you any further than that ship on my own, and I'm very much on my own at the moment."</p>

<p>"Busted for <em>what?</em> I asked.</p>

<p>"Obviously you got more than just the boost serum.  Some Curator might have slipped the Witnesses a suggestion about that.  But now you need to find out just what they really did so you can figure out what to do about it."</p>

<p>We folded to the starship moments before our front door was broken down.  On the alien starship we were just human hangers-on, metabolism type 23, showed up mysteriously but to the aliens your mere presence, however unexplainable, indicated the right to air, quarters, food, privacy, and transport to your next destination if there was a ship going that way.</p>

<p>Our first journey to visit to the Witnesses in the <em>Horse Pill</em> had taken less than an hour.  Taking regularly scheduled galactic transports, with the usual turnaround times between each leg, our return was going to take at least a year.</p>

<p>"There was a double flash," Red said.  From what was apparently the former orbital position of the manufactory the neutron star was very faint, and it just barely visibly flashed every five seconds or so.</p>

<p>"There was the flash of the ball of neutronium destroying the planet, like a small nova," Red continued, "but almost at the same time there was another fainter and more prolonged flash.  The thing is if you carve out a cubic kilometer of a star like the Sun it doesn't even get heartburn, but for a neutron star that's a about a tenth of a percent of its entire mass.  We're pretty sure the star had a major quake and ejected a shell of hot particles microseconds after the core was drawn."</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"By looking at the light shell from different angles we could establish the order of the events and their arrangement in space, so we know pretty exactly where the planet was when Callie destroyed it."</p>

<p>"Was it ever habitable?"</p>

<p>"No.  A star big enough to collapse into a neutron star would only be on the main sequence for maybe 20 million years.  This star lived fast, died young, and its habitable zone would have been all over the place as it evolved."</p>

<p>"Any other planets?"</p>

<p>"No, and we've looked.  The problem is that when the star goes supernova it loses most of its mass, so any planets generally fly off into interstellar space.  We think this world orbited close when the star was a red giant and was in a pretty elliptical orbit to this day."</p>

<p>"Then why are we here?"</p>

<p>"We are trying to think like the Ancestors who put a bit of important kit in this system, and who our Curator friends think were a lot like us.  The question of why they came here is a very good one we need to answer."</p>

<p>"Well it was a very remote private place, I suppose," I said.</p>

<p>"Lots of more convenient but equally remote and private places in the main galaxy."</p>

<p>"No other stars nearby?"</p>

<p>"We did a pretty fine survey.  Nothing luminous enough to compete with the galaxy itself."</p>

<p>I was thinking about the distances involved.  Putting anything in this system was just <em>crazy</em>.  Just getting to it would be...</p>

<p>"Unless..." I said aloud.</p>

<p>"Please enlighten us," Red said.</p>

<p>"Suppose it was a binary system, and the other star was like Sol.  The supernova is ancient history, it went off when the other system was young.  Then life evolves at the other more stable star.  One day that life needs a really remote place to do a test.  A test you don't dare do in your home system."</p>

<p>"<em>The fold drive?</em>"</p>

<p>"So they come out here and they build it here.  And after it works this is where they've got the tech in place to build more stuff.  It's nice and safe and access is easily controlled, and the home system is probably busy with all kinds of other traffic anyway.  And once you have the fold moving between the two systems is easy."</p>

<p>"There's just one problem.  There isn't another star anywhere around."</p>

<p>"Would you have detected it if it was a white dwarf?"</p>

<p>Red just looked at me for about thirty seconds.  "You have to be fucking kidding me," he finally said.</p>

<p>I slowly shook my head.  "You wanted to know why they came here.  You give me a better reason."</p>

<p>"Why a fucking white dwarf?"</p>

<p>"Because it's that old.  This star wasn't on the main sequence more than twenty million years or so.  But if there's a companion, it might have been more like Sol.  And if it was, it could have gone through its own red giant phase and senescence.  But it might also still have its planetary system."</p>

<p>"I have to talk to my astro guys.  If you're jerking me around..."</p>

<p>"Really, Red?"</p>

<p>He sniffed.  "Okay, you got a point.  But I am going to seriously be pissed off if this turns out to be a snipe hunt."</p>

<p>"Says the guy who dragged me out to the galactic halo," I said under my breath after he was gone.</p>

<hr>

<p>Red's fold ship returned to Earth so he could take possession of one of the largest Schmidt sky-survey cameras ever made.  I stayed and while Red grumbled about that he didn't protest too strenuously.  I honestly had nothing to do out there.</p>

<p>Callie invited me to visit her at the monastery in Japan.  I was a bit reluctant, but I didn't want to return to the Pinwheel in case Red's team found something out in the halo, and I really didn't have much else to do even on Earth.</p>

<p>Callie greeted me herself at the door.  "Welcome," she said.  "Can I interest you in some sake?"</p>

<p>She introduced me to her spiritual guides over small bowls of hot rice wine.  To my surprise, the abbess was a woman.  "Callie tells me you take a dim view of human religious practices," she said pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I've seen too many of them," I said.</p>

<p>She nodded.  "I can imagine.  We should get along well though because our order also takes a dim view of most such things."</p>

<p>She gave me a chance to react and then laughed out loud.  "Yes, this is a monastery, but we don't prosyletize or claim to have special knowledge of anything, except how to reduce our own suffering by applying the lessons the Buddha taught us.  Many of us, including Callie, call ourselves 'secular Buddhists.'  We know the Wheel of Life is not exactly what our ancestors thought it was, but that doesn't mean the Buddha's lessons should be discarded or ignored.  In practice they prove very helpful."</p>

<p>I took a careful sip of the rice wine, which was quite good.  I looked at Callie.  "So how's that working out?" I asked her.</p>

<p>"Better than I expected," she said.  "I was ready to try anything.  This worked better than cutting my wrists."</p>

<p>I almost dropped my sake.</p>

<p>"Callie came to us in a great deal of pain," the Abbess said.  "Few of us have your resources for managing the kind of experience she went through.  Your people would probably say we are all children, and they would probably be right.  Gautama taught us that rituals can be a source of both comfort and discipline when everything around us is chaos."</p>

<p>"Callie, you saved the galaxy.  Two galaxies."</p>

<p>She looked me in the eye.  "I told myself I was doing what had to be done.  And maybe it did.  But I didn't do it because it had to be done.  I didn't know whether it had to be done.  I did it because at that moment I hated them so much I didn't care if I killed myself killing them.  I didn't expect your safety system to save me.  In my dark moments I still wish that it hadn't.  But those moments aren't as frequent now."</p>

<p>I looked at the Abbess.  </p>

<p>"We're fortunate now that we have the mortality Cure, so we have as much time as we need to work through these things," she said.  "Maybe, eventually, we won't be children any more."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Callie," I said.  "I'll do whatever..."</p>

<p>"Andrew, everybody I loved died that day, except you.  And I wanted to die too.  I was ready to die with my family, and I should have.  But you didn't let me.  And I still love you.  I am so afraid that I will lose you too and then I will be completely alone."  And she sobbed quietly.</p>

<p>I started to say something but the Abbess waved her finger to stop me.  "These sorrows can be more than we know how to bear," she said as she hugged Callie.  "She needs time and closure.  It would help if you could find out exactly what she <em>did</em> destroy out there."</p>

<p>"We are working on that," I said.</p>

<hr>

<p>I got the message from Red six months later.  I saw Callie a few more times and came to understand the depth of her grief a bit better.  Even at their worst it is rarely the case that humans don't care, and often the case that they care too much.</p>

<p>Red found the companion star.  It was indeed a white dwarf, and it had been hard to spot because from the neutron star it was currently backlit by the Milky Way.  But they had anticipated that possibility and been meticulous in their search.  It was a third of a light year from the neutron star, and there were three gas giants with a total of twelve solid-surface moons between them.</p>

<p>There were no inner rocky worlds, but they might have all been swallowed by the star when it was a red giant.  Or folded into it earlier than that.  We had no way to know.</p>

<p>"So you were right," Red said.  "But there's also no obvious Ancestral home world.  So what now?"</p>

<p>"If we assume this is a place where a sentient species evolved, then we know they went to the neutron star because we found their tech there.  I don't believe for a nanosecond that the Curators came out here from the galactic disk to build their Manufactory.  So this was the Ancestors, and if I was an Ancestor the first reason for going to the neutron star would be to test the fold drive constants in a place where it doesn't matter so much if you accidentally blow the closest planet away."</p>

<p>"But before you do that," I went on, "you have to get into space in the first place.  You can't get to other stars, you can't get to the galaxy, so where do you go?  At first you probably can't even get to the neutron star and its one little world you don't know exists.  You go to the other worlds of your system which you can get to and which you do know exist.  You've still got gas giants with systems of moons, moons you could walk on with suitable protection.  They would have <em>explored</em> those worlds."</p>

<p>"And who bothers to retrieve an exploration probe or life habitat that's malfunctioned or finished its mission?" Red said, completing my thought.</p>

<p>"Nobody.  We need to look for their exploration trash."</p>

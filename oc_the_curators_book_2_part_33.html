<p>Not that we expected Curators to interest themselves in electromagnetic waves, we took no risks and maintained silence on all communication bands while the Curators were on the <em>Nostromo</em>.  We waited a few moments while Andrew, now formally a rogue Curator himself, reviewed the recording of our interview.</p>

<p>"The fact that they are still concerned about this after so many years is not good," he finally said.  "Curators tend to either quickly solve problems that bother them or give them up as being pointless diversions.  I believe that these two, and probably others, have been working on this problem continuously since they realized that my disappearance and the return of Nemesis' implant were coincident.  It probably just took them this long to get around to coming here.  I doubt they have any real evidence that you or the Terra Nova operation is involved, because they would have been here much sooner if they did, but the problem is that by human standards they will never stop.  This is an existential priority for them and they can spend tens or hundreds of thousands of years working on it."</p>

<p>While he spoke I poured us shots of moonshine.  "How long do you think we have?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"Unknowable.  They have probably already tracked down and spoken to everyone who had any interaction with Nemesis at all in the years before her breakdown.  They have probably spent a great deal of time retracing her steps on Earth.  They may or may not be aware of the agency that helped me kill Nemesis; if they are the agents can't have divulged much.  But I have little doubt the <em>agency</em> is aware of <em>them</em>.  Tracking Curators who visit Earth is what they <em>do</em>."</p>

<p>"So it's just a matter of time?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Again, unknowable.  The human agents were very circumspect in all their dealings with me.  The most bothersome thing is that the Curators went back to Earth when they left you.  There are people on Earth who know you have the missing ships, although not why.  There are people there who know I was there to assassinate Nemesis.  Many of our crew have acquaintances on Earth.  We have been recruiting there for years.  They already know you and I are long acquainted.  There are no clear lines connecting any of those dots but all of those dots <em>are on Earth</em> and that makes Earth the linchpin of our real secret."</p>

<p>"Is there any chance they could track your amplifier?"</p>

<p>"Only if I use it to do something outrageous like moving a planet.  Physically it only exists in this universe as a dimensionless point.  Foldwise I've been using it as an extra-massive microfold scanner and that isn't detectable at a distance."</p>

<p>"What will they do if they return?"</p>

<p>"That strongly depends on what they know or suspect."</p>

<p>"Suppose they connect all the dots?"</p>

<p>"That would be very bad.  They're not stupid.  You took the ships and you are here aboard one of them, and we're not maintaining fold quiet because that wouldn't make sense for a fold lab.  It's unlikely they would find the ships on the moon at random but things are different if they decide to actively search the system.  And once they know about the ships on the moon they know you would not devote such resources to what you have admitted is a quixotic vanity project on Terra Nova."</p>

<p>"So they could know everything already?"</p>

<p>"No, because they would already have moved to destroy us if they did.  It will take them more than a passing glance to realize what you are really trying to do and that you might actually succeed.  If they had any idea how much you have already accomplished here they would destroy us all without warning or quarter."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I would expect at least four amplifiers dedicated to folding Terra Nova and its moon into its sun.  They would be certain of overwhelming any fold inhibitor your people are capable of deploying.  They would do it without warning immediately on arrival in the system, probably from the outer system to confuse our fold detectors as much as possible before we could react.  Remember they <em>have</em> fought a fold war and there are records of it."</p>

<p>"I think we need to leave," Emma said.</p>

<p>"I don't think we're ready," I said.</p>

<p>"We will never be as ready as we want to be.  We will also never be ready if Andrew's people come for us," Emma countered.  To Andrew she asked, "How soon could they be here?  What's the worst case scenario?"</p>

<p>"If they are in the process of cementing their suspicions, it will take them about a day to reserve and arrange to remove the war locks on the amplifiers.  They will not start that process until they are absolutely certain of what they intend to do, and they wouldn't have visited here if they had already decided.  And I don't think they would have gone to Earth if their next priority was to come after us."</p>

<p>"But Earth is also where all the clues are.  And if they do decide we threaten them there will be no warning."</p>

<p>"You just got as much as you ever will."</p>

<p>"We need to fucking <em>leave</em>," Emma said.</p>

<p>"I tend to agree," Andrew added.</p>

<p>"Well.  I guess I'm outvoted."  We were still in the conference room where we had met the Curators, so there was a ship comm console.  I dialed the Executive Officer and put it on speaker.</p>

<p>"XO here."</p>

<p>"XO this is king Jay.  I am with queen Emma.  We need immediate private comms with all the captains.  This is a code ultraviolet priority."</p>

<p>"Excuse me Jay, did you say code <em>ultraviolet</em>?"</p>

<p>"And I meant it, Saul."</p>

<p>"Working."  About twenty seconds passed.  "Awaiting confirmation.  A couple of them have to find privacy.  Four...five...six...Ready.  You are connected."</p>

<p>"Captains, this is king Jay."</p>

<p>"And this is queen Emma," Emma said.</p>

<p>"All of you please acknowledge."  The comm panel lit up with icons indicating that our communication had been received and understood.</p>

<p>"We are immediately initiating plan <em>breaking pinwheel</em>," I said.</p>

<p>"Immediately initiate plan <em>breaking pinwheel</em>," Emma verified.</p>

<p>"The <em>Long Shot</em> and <em>Nostromo</em> will remain for one hour to collect crew who are not onboard.  Captain Wiegand will remain available for immediate instruction in case we have to alter that.  The rest of you will leave <em>now</em> without pausing to retrieve crew or materiel.  Forward to the <em>Long Shot</em> lists of all personnel known to be offboard so we can collect them.  Acknowledge."  I punched the control to wipe the acknowledge icons and watched them reappear.</p>

<p>"Captain Wiegand stay with me, the rest of you get moving."  A few seconds later only the captains of the <em>Long Shot</em> and our own ship <em>Nostromo</em> were still on the comm.</p>

<p>"Sir and Madam," Captain Wiegand said.  "The lists have come through from the other ships.  I have about thirty personnel to retrieve in eight locations."</p>

<p>"Send your star shuttle and use its fold drive.  Time is the only factor to consider.  As soon as you have all those people, or in no more than one hour if you should be unable to find any of them, join the others."</p>

<p>"Understood," he said.  Only the captain of the Nostromo remained on the comm link.</p>

<p>"Jay, Emma, we have at least three hundred people out on the surface.  We don't even have a comprehensive list because there's no formal checkout from this ship.  We need at least a day to find them all."</p>

<p>"They will be all right.  Terra Nova is a habitable world and they all have transportation, ground infrastructure in place for the necessities of life, and a microfold transceiver if they need to call someone else for rescue.  If all goes well we will be able to come back for them.  But we leave in an hour no matter what.  Make sure everybody understands that."</p>

<p>"It's really that bad?"</p>

<p>"We can't be certain, but if you knew how bad it <em>could be</em> you wouldn't be wasting time asking us."</p>

<p>"Got it.  Understood."</p>

<p>"I hope we're doing the right thing," I said after he left the comm.</p>

<p>"You may never know that," Andrew said gently.  "Take it from someone who has lived a <em>very</em> long time.  But when you do the <em>wrong</em> thing, you often become quite certain of that shortly."</p>

<p>I nodded, and we moved to do what we could to assist in the evacuation of Terra Nova.</p>

<p>Over the course of the next year I made several trips between the Plasma base and Earth.  I left one of the drones in attendance at the entry portal, and it recorded only three new arrivals during that time.  Helen learned that it took eight standard Curator years -- about thirteen Earth years -- to make a planet killer.  Their operation was not nearly as advanced as the old Manufactory, and they were making a more complicated design than the prototype that had been used against Terminus.</p>

<p>There were four bays like the one I'd originally surveilled, each with a capacity of about 8,000 manufacturing pods.  Their output was staggered so that one bay matured every three Earth years.  Their yield was below fifty percent though.  This gave them an overall production capacity of a couple of thousand units per Earth year.</p>

<p>It had taken them centuries to redevelop even this level of their old technology, and they had only had this level of production for about a hundred Curator years.  So somewhere there was an inventory of around a quarter of a million of the damn things.</p>

<p>At that point there were about a trillion humans mostly in the Four not-Milky Way Galaxies, and because DENT technology favors developing small worlds such as gas giant moons they lived on nearly a million worlds.  The Plasma were intent that they would have a double surplus of planet killers before launching their attack, and they were fairly open with their recruits that the plan would not mature for another fifty to one hundred standard Curator years.  Because the Plasma base was considered a safe haven, most of its residents were simply waiting for their chance to be useful.</p>

<p>Every once in awhile the Plasma leaders considered whether to build more manufacturing capacity, but at the moment they were well ahead of the rate of human expansion and they felt they would be ready to strike before the exponential human population growth outstripped their linear manufacturing capacity.</p>

<p>Helen remained worried that my activities might compromise her, but I was open with her about my techniques and precautions and she gradually came to trust my discretion.  One mystery was the location of the murder ball inventory.  It wasn't in the city; we were able to account for all the enclosed spaces there.  If they were dormant it would be difficult to find them through a global search without revealing my activities.  And they might not be on the base world, since they had interstellar fold capability.  The stabilizing moon seemed unlikely since its vacuum would initialize their destruct sequence, but there were other worlds with atmospheres and for that matter many other star systems.</p>

<p>Fortunately there was a new graduating class every three Earth years, and all it took was patience to be present when the next group matured.  I had plenty of time to figure out where I wanted to be and when they started leaving I secreted my bioform within a storage locker in the factory close enough to feel their fold departures.</p>

<p>At the rate of one every few minutes the planet killers performed a self-check sequence, which about half of them failed.  Those that passed folded out to a destination on the far side of the base world.  I didn't believe this was a feint, since fold following evasion was a bit beyond what these simple machines could be expected to do.  I felt several of them make their exit and then did my own fold to a nearby plateau where I could surveil the arrival area.</p>

<p>They were arriving underground.  I was able to sense an extensive cave system which was being filled with distinctly non-geographically native matter.  After the graduation exodus I folded into the cave and found the inventory, hundreds of thousands of neatly stacked smooth gray spheres.  I thought of grabbing one but then realized I didn't need to.  There was no way they could move all this stuff out without some pretty elaborate preparation which obviously hadn't been done.</p>

<p>"You could have taken one," Helen said when I showed her the memory of what I'd found.  "They want the surplus for the attack because they know more will fail.  Should one not answer their call they will simply assume it went dead."</p>

<p>"It would be hard to explain its presence if found, and I can't take it offworld both because they are too big for my native implant interstellar fold payload and because folding them to an intermediate destination in vacuum would trigger them to destroy my arrival destination."</p>

<p>"Good point," Helen agreed.</p>

<p>Helen and I discussed what had to be done to destroy them completely enough that they could not come back again.  For the most part we stopped meeting physically and exchanged covert microfold pings between my campsite and her flat as she appeared to be resting quietly.  At first she was worried that this activity could be detected, but I showed her exactly which features she was taking for granted in the control system of her implant made that kind of surveillance possible for the two of us, but not for other Curators.</p>

<p>"I think folding this planet into its sun is the only safe thing to be sure of destroying the manufacturing capacity and inventory," I said.  "Even a solar bomb could leave the infrastructure salvageable, as it did at Terminus."</p>

<p>"Agreed.  But unless you hit them with the fold following worm first when you fold them into the Sun their implants will just go find new hosts, they will regroup, and they will do it again."</p>

<p>"Can't they detect fold following infections now?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, and they test the entire population frequently.  They know that if the level three pass code becomes unresponsive, the worm is the most likely reason.  If anyone ever tested positive, which hasn't happened for hundreds of years, they get a choice between exile and a nice interstellar trip on a fold ship."</p>

<p>"Pity I didn't think of making the worm stealthier."</p>

<p>"Yes, it would seem to have reached the limit of its usefulness.  Then again you didn't have the Ancestral programming knowledge you do now when you created it.  Considering your level of knowledge at the time it was quite a clever hack."</p>

<p>"And even after it infects them, it doesn't prevent them from folding off under their own power.  You'd have to somehow infect everyone almost instantly and fold the world out from under them before they had a chance to notice."</p>

<p>"Yes, and we'd need a machine that can do the world-folding thing.  Those are frowned upon elsewhere."</p>

<p>"There's a whole cave full of them just on the other side of this world."</p>

<p>"True, but we don't have the codes to activate them for remote operation, and I'm not sure we can get them."</p>

<p>"One of us could always take one out of the atmosphere and do a fold."</p>

<p>"Yes, as long as we don't mind our bioform taking the trip along with the Plasma.  And I have Witness style vacuum defenses, so I'd have about fifteen seconds of consciousness to complete the operation.  Do-able, but not unless it's pre-planned and executed without hesitation."</p>

<p>"I could do it more easily."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you like being human and while the humans put up with you now they've made it clear they wouldn't put up with you if you came back and took another new human host."</p>

<hr />

<p>And so the humans continued to add worlds to their DENT inventory at the rate of about a hundred a year, the pile of murder balls in the hidden cave grew by about two thousand a year, and little else changed.  Helen studied the deep history of the Plasma, at least the version they were willing to teach her to encourage an enthusiastic recruit, and back on Earth and elsewhere our analysts took that story apart looking for clues to their real history.</p>

<p>Of course our most populous worlds were protected by fold defenses which would probably stop the murder balls.  Terminus was once again a vibrant capital and there were dozens more worlds like it in the Five Galaxies.  Once a world had a population of more than a few hundred million it was standard to outfit it with fold defenses on general principles.</p>

<p>But most human worlds had more modest populations, which is one reason the Plasma needed so many copies of their weapon.  It would be hard to justify the manufacturing effort necessary to protect every human world from an attack that had not been repeated in a millennium, and which humans increasingly believed would never be repeated.  And the vast majority of humans in the Universe, well over ninety percent, lived on such worlds.  </p>

<p>Those of us who knew the secret of the threat also knew that if the attack happened, the human survivors would not be amused.  The Plasma would flee to the corners of the galaxy as they had after the attack on Terminus, and the humans would return to their home galaxy ready to do whatever was necessary to make sure it never happened again.</p>

<p>They would be outnumbered by vastly more numerous and ancient races, with far greater resources and the advantage of skills humans had taught them.  And it wouldn't matter.  There would be a holocaust such as the galaxy had never seen, and nothing even slightly suspect would be allowed to survive.  This is the other thing we were trying to prevent.</p>

<p>If the Plasma struck, there was no force in history that could stop the human survivors from burning the Curators' entire Galactic garden to the ground.</p>

<hr />

<p>I visited the Plasma base world a bit randomly.  Veronica had taught both Helen and me that you always vary your schedule when being evasive.  I expected this visit to be no different from any other, probably limited entirely in the wooded area where I preferred to camp and my business conducted via microfold pings to Helen.</p>

<p>Within moments of my arrival though she sent me a dense blast of information.  While I was sifting through this I received a top priority alert from her:  <em>Get to the moon.  I will make sure it is safe there.  You have about ten seconds.</em></p>

<p>I spent about five of those seconds considering options before I realized that if she was about to do what I thought she was about to do, it would be impossible for me to stop her.  So I folded to the moon, and a couple of seconds later watched the Plasma base world disappear.</p>

<p>Even with my Curator vacuum defenses I didn't have a lot of time to spend contemplating the situation.  There were no responses to any of my test pings for Curator implant communication at any level.  So in due course I folded back to the nearest habitable Indexed world and found an inn with an open room.</p>

<p>We rushed to the door of the embassy and knocked, fortunately getting their attention and gaining entrance before anyone outside noticed us.  There were only a few embassy personnel present at that time, but M knew two of them personally and they expressed shock at our arrival because they were certain they knew of every human on Kattegat.</p>

<p>We hustled off to the embassy's most private communications room and arranged a hasty microfold call to Earth.  There M, the raider-form Curator, and I each told our stories four times to successively higher level officials; our audience for the last retelling included the President of the United States and the highest leaders of several of our allies.</p>

<p>"What do the Curators recommend?" the Director asked of our Curator, without mentioning that one of the humans on his end was actually also a Curator.</p>

<p>"The raiders are a proud people who will be strongly tempted to react in kind.  We have been inclined to forgive what they did in their attack on you, because it was unintended and the result of your surpise show of force, and they seem to be as horrified as everyone else and have directed their space captains to make sure it never happens again.  But the possibility of this escalating is strong and we must not allow that."</p>

<p>"We will have the same problem here on Earth," someone who sounded an awful lot like the President said.</p>

<p>"The number of people who know about this is still very limited.  Keeping a lid on it should still be possible."</p>

<p>"We still have to deal with the Sevillians."</p>

<p>"The Sevillians are our children and we reserve the right to discipline them in our own way.  We need to find out how deep this rot goes into their culture.  It is wasteful to fell the tree if only one branch is diseased."</p>

<p>"We need assurance that the problem is completely contained."</p>

<p>"I believe we can achieve that," came a voice from Earth we recognized as our human-form Curator.  "We should chat a bit offline before finalizing decisions."</p>

<p>That seemed to inspire general agreement.  After we ended the call, the raider-form Curator reminded us, "You two are still rock stars here.  Everyone will go crazy if they find out you have returned, and thats even without considering that you just saved their world.  We should depart as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"Our fold ship <em>Edge of Space</em> is on the roof of the power station and scheduled to return to Earth this afternoon.  If we could quietly get M and J to the ship they could just take a stateroom and be on Earth within a day."</p>

<p>"I can get them there discreetly," the raider said.  She offered us her hands, and moments later we were on the ship.</p>

<p><em>Edge of Space</em> was a converted Boeing 747 and the captain showed us to a well-appointed room where we could safely hide from everyone else who was scheduled to fly with us.  That gave us a chance to grab some sleep and some more entertaining not-sleep before touching down at JFK.  Our human-form Curator was there to meet us, and after we ducked into a hidden corner of the airport he folded us over to the fold project base.</p>

<p>If the rest of Earth and Kattegat were blissfully unaware of our brushes with genocide, the base was a beehive of activity.  We had folded into the area where the fold inhibitor and span limiter had been built, and technicians were swarming over the inhibitor.  "What the hell is going on?" M asked.</p>

<p>"We have engaged in one of your human rituals and made a purchase from you.  We have offered a price for which to buy your fold inhibitor.  We got a good deal because we had basically told you we wouldn't let you use it yourselves anyway."</p>

<p>"And what did you pay us for it?"</p>

<p>"Full technical theory of the operation of gravity plating.  We offer a guarantee that you will be able to manufacture your own with your known existing manufacturing techniques and no use of nanites."</p>

<p>"That sounds fair," M said.</p>

<p>"Indeed, we expect it will lead you to a few more things.  Meanwhile we have an immediate use for the inhibitor and no time to build our own."</p>

<p>"Seville?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  Our agents there report that the general public has no knowledge of what was done in their name.  Action must be taken but we hope that genocidal methods can be avoided this time.  Here, we need to clear a space."  At his direction everyone backed away from an area of the floor and a machine folded into it.  It wasn't very big, and had the kind of gleaming perfect construction one might expect from molecular nanoassembly.  Two aliens of different semi-humanoid species stepped out of it and one of them presented our Curator with what looked like a metal-link belt.  Both of them sported the Mark of the Curators prominently, one on its forehead and the other on its lower back.</p>

<p>"More of our agents," our Curator said.  "These are machines we use when we are terraforming and need to fold large apertures or work from uninhabitable spaces."</p>

<p>The new aliens took some measurements of the span limiter, and spoke with our Curator in alien tongue for a few moments.  Then they got in their space pod and folded out.</p>

<p>"They will be arranging an operating environment and power supply for it," our Curator said.</p>

<p>"On Seville?"</p>

<p>"No, that would be too vulnerable.  Deep below the surface of Seville's moon."</p>

<p>I thought of the effort that had been necessary for humans to reach our own Moon without the fold drive.  With the inhibitor operating the Sevillians would be cut off from the rest of the galaxy and incapable of reaching the thing that was cutting them off.  I almost felt sorry for them for a moment.</p>

<p>"So what's the belt for?" I asked innocently.</p>

<p>"It's an amplifier for our personal fold drives, which are normally tuned for an aperture the size of our bodies.  I can fold my own body about a hundred light-years and cancel the likely velocity differences I'd find at that range with my implanted drive.  But if I hold your hands and include you in the aperture, my range drops to a light-year or so and my ability to cancel velocity drops too.  I would not be able to get your fold inhibitor to your own Moon on my own, much less to Seville's.  But with this, I can fold an asteroid half-way across the galaxy, or an entire rocky planet a good distance across its solar system.  These are the tools we use to explore and create new inhabitable worlds."</p>

<p>"That sounds insanely dangerous," I said.</p>

<p>"Only Curators with implanted drives can use these tools, and only when properly unlocked.  We restrict access to those who have a need for them.  I will be returning this when we have taken care of the current situation."</p>

<p>"You keep these on your homeworld?" M asked.</p>

<p>At this the Curator hesitated.  "No," he said with a hint of emotion.  "Our homeworld was destroyed aeons ago when our home star, which was much like your Sol, entered the next phase of its stellar evolution and became a red giant."</p>

<p>"Surely you could have saved it?"</p>

<p>"That was considered," he said heavily.  "But if we moved it to a new orbit it would no longer be harmonically tuned to our system's other worlds.  Our leaders then realized that there are some things in the cosmos that simply end.  By that time we were quite capable of walking among our children undetected and we decided to move into the garden we'd spent so much effort to create.  We have caches all over the galaxy of tools we might need once in awhile, and of course we continue to do what we have always done and create new inhabitable worlds."</p>

<p>"Do you remember your homeworld?"</p>

<p>"Oh no.  We can live a very long time; I personally met one of the team who arranged your Earth's K-T impactor event.  But Home was swallowed by our sun more than four billion of your years ago.  It's not that we remember our home, but that we don't really have one at all now."</p>

<p>"You met someone who helped wipe out the dinosaurs?  Is he still on Earth?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, he was part of the long-term evolution team.  They were the ones who decided life had settled into an unuseful equilibrium and made the decision to disrupt it.  Once it became clear that one of your ancestral species was likely to enter the critical path, they all moved out for other projects.  I was part of the new team to foster critical path development.  More experts came in as your ancestors approached, entered, and ascended the path.  And of course there are other teams that specialize in early solar-system engineering to make stable orbits and stabilizing moons for habitable worlds, and then for seeding and nurturing early life."</p>

<p>"When did you come to Earth?"</p>

<p>"Relatively recently, about three hundred thousand years ago.  But humans are my fifth professional project.  You're going to make a mark on my resume, too."</p>

<p>I was about to say something when two of M's pilot friends recognized her and hailed us.  "So you two slew the deadly fold ship again," one of them said.</p>

<p>"Getting to be a bad habit," M said modestly.</p>

<p>"Well we took care of the one here.  Even brought our ship back in one piece.  Good thing too since it was <em>Grasshopper</em>."</p>

<p>"You two flew my ship?"</p>

<p>"It's the only one with both the sunlight cannon and the new manually adjustable aperture fold drive."</p>

<p>"I thought we were going to nuke them."</p>

<p>"After you left some of the bigwigs got cold feet about that.  We reviewed what you guys did to the raiders, and decided to try drilling it with the sunlight cannon instead.  When it stopped retrying the bad fold we enveloped it and folded it into a collision course with Venus."</p>

<p>"Venus?"  I said.  "Why not the Sun or the Moon?"</p>

<p>"Moon's too accessible," the other pilot said nonchalantly.  "Didn't want anyone trying to pick up the pieces and put it back together.  Sun would have taken too long, a month or more to fall in depending on how close we dared folding in to leave it.  With Venus we could fold into the planet's nighttime shadow, RCS away from the enemy drone, fold just ourselves out, and an hour later whatever's left of it after impact is melting on the surface."</p>

<p>"Smooth," M said.</p>

<p>"And we brought your ship back in one piece," the first pilot repeated.</p>

<p>"Well your target didn't have two fold drives and wasn't shooting at you."</p>

<p>A little while later one of the human technicians approached us.  "I was told to tell you when we were ready, sir," he said to the Curator.</p>

<p>"Is the away installation team ready to depart?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Have them stand on top of the inhibitor with all the parts and tools they will need for the installation as if we are preparing for a group photo.  I'll join you shortly."  He turned to us.  "I'd like the two of you to come with us if you can," he said.  "There are truths that must be penetrated at Seville before we activate this machine, and your presence would probably help."</p>

<p>The inhibitor itself was about three meters high and ten meters across.  We all climbed the stairs and stood atop it.  Our Curator looked at his belt with a hint of a smile and raised his arms.</p>

<p>Then the whole machine and all of us were in a new space much more brightly and evenly lit and we were a lot less heavy.  We, the machine, and the whole crew and their tools had folded to a new world without falling toward an attractor to adjust velocity, without using a RCS to adjust our orientation, and without doing any course corrections.  We were in a freshly made cavern with life support and power on Seville's moon, over eighty light-years from Earth, and we had folded in with a large machine to make perfect contact with the floor in one seamless step.</p>

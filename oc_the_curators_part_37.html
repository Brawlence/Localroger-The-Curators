<p><em>Four Years Later</em></p>

<p><em>Promethean Uplift Project +26</em></p>

<p>Once they had aircars, the Prometheans didn't need our help to explore the environmental conditions of space.  A levitation aircar could reach an altitude of over forty kilometers, and while it couldn't go any higher or accelerate to orbital velocity, that was outer space for all practical testing purposes.</p>

<p>It was a surprise to us to find out they had mostly working pressure suits.  They were custom fitted and hand-sewn, but then so were human pressure suits in our early space travel days.  They had also finally figured out how to make electronically controlled liquid crystal light filters in order to deal with the glare above the atmosphere, and the computer people were now taking an interest in those as low-power display elements.</p>

<p>There was frantic knocking on our door around midday one day and we opened it to find our lab director holding a radio transcription slip.  "There has been some kind of mishap," he said.  "The pressure suit people have lost contact with their aircar."</p>

<p>"Has it crashed?"</p>

<p>"It's still at altitude.  The automated transponders are still operating, but they have no contact with the pilot."</p>

<p>"That's not good," M said.  "Let's go."</p>

<p>M didn't waste any time.  Once we were high enough she folded us right to the vicinity of the experiment, which was over two thousand kilometers away.  Fortunately the aircar was equipped with a strobe so we quickly found it.  There was no response to our attempts to communicate.  It was obvious we would have to EVA to find out what was going on, and since the <em>Plausibile Deniability</em> didn't have an airlock, that would mean both of us donning our own pressure suits which we hadn't worn in decades.</p>

<p>Fortunately modern human technology is really good and our biological modifications had kept our body dimensions stable.  Unfortunately, we quickly figured out that human made pressure suits were not designed to be properly sealed if you are furry.  It took us long minutes of fiddling to get the clamps shut and even then both of our suits hissed leakage as we went about the rescue.</p>

<p>Since we weren't in orbit M stayed behind to pilot the <em>Plausible</em> and I took the tether and descended to the Promethean aircar.  The pilot was unconscious and it was clear that his suit had lost integrity.  It must have happened suddenly because the aircar had an emergency return sequence.  It couldn't be activated remotely because the pilot had been in the middle of an experiment that shut down the emergency returns while it was in progress when his suit failed.  I reset everything and started the ship back, then M hauled me back in with the tether winch.</p>

<p>We followed the aircar down and met with the researchers.  They thanked us profusely and we offered our condolances.  Being Prometheans, they just said they now had work to do, and we left them in short order so they could get to it.</p>

<p>Back at our lab M made a close inspection of the seals of our suits that had pinched our fur.  "The fur might not have been such a good idea," she said after finding the metal polishing kit.</p>

<p>"Without the fur I'd never have been able to retrieve the documents from Earth that were the basis for all of this," I reminded her.</p>

<p>She sighed.  "That's true.  But you know, as much as I've gotten used to not needing clothes, we really don't need to be furry here."</p>

<p>"We need to make a visit to the Witnesses then."</p>

<p>We didn't tell the Prometheans exactly what we were up to, only that we would be gone for a few days and that it wasn't to some dangerous place like Earth.  Even though we had no way to forewarn them, the Prometheans still not being on the microfold network, the Witnesses received our direct communications from the <em>Plausible</em> beyond the range of their fold inhibitor and they opened their defenses so we could land in their palace courtyard again.  We were again received us as honored guests.</p>

<p>We were again offered clothing, which like the pressure suits now fit awkwardly over our fur.  At the usual lavish dinner, when we explained our reason for returning the President chuckled and nodded.  "We expected you might have an alternation of needs," she said, "which is why we built in an epigenetic switch."  She motioned and an assistant approached and handed us two bottles of pills.  "The red pills turn your fur on, and the blue pills turn it off and restore your natural human hair pattern.  You need to take one a day for ten days to get a proper dose of each, and when turning your fur off it will take about a week after you run the course for all the fur to fall out.  Be careful with those, because both of those drugs are highly toxic to unmodified humans.  These bottles should allow you to switch several times and we will gladly make more for you if you find you need them."</p>

<p>"Your anticipation skills are remarkable," I said.</p>

<p>"We have been doing this for a <em>very</em> long time."</p>

<p>"Now we will need clothing," M said.  "An entire wardrobe."</p>

<p>"Please stay with us while you de-fur.  I'm sure you will remember our textile expert.  He has been learning as much as he can about human fashion and I'm sure he will be delighted to have more than one human to make clothes for."</p>

<p>M and I looked at one another.  "Is there another human here?" she asked.  "Did our people find you?"</p>

<p>The President nodded.  "Indeed they did.  We should have dinner together again tomorrow and we will catch up on past events."</p>

<p>M and I found our quarters, took our pills, and found the textile shop where the Witness we'd met over twenty years before was effusive in his delight at seeing us.</p>

<p>"We hear you have another customer," M said casually.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, <em>that</em> guy.  His interests are so narrow though.  Jeans and T-shirts and underwear.  He has no interest at all in showing flair."</p>

<p>The next evening we were already seated when he joined us.  Despite the age regression we recognized him instantly. "The last time we saw you you promised to kill us," M shouted.</p>

<p>"A younger and stupider person," Q said.  "I have to admit that if we had met even ten years ago I probably would have tried to kill you.  But that was before I caught my girlfriend sleeping with my first lieutenant and killed them both."</p>

<p>"You are not improving your case," M said evenly.</p>

<p>"I don't know what they did to me.  I do know immortality didn't work out very well for any of my companions.  My best friend since childhood went back to Earth and disappeared, and I'm sure that if he's still alive he's in a steel box somewhere being tortured to find out exactly what doesn't kill him.  And when I killed her I realized there was a hole in my heart I had never felt before, and it hurt in ways I had never imagined were possible."</p>

<p>The President said, "As part of the Cure we fixed their emotional defect.  Your people keep changing its name but in your generation it was called sociopathy.  It's a genetic defect in the operation of an oxytocin receptor, which affects between one and two percent of your population at random.  It's an interesting case of otherwise unrelated genes crossing purposes.  Our technology can fortunately fix it."</p>

<p>"This man left a trap intended to destroy your world."</p>

<p>"Not intended," Q said.  "We were just stupid.  We really thought our technology was so much better that nobody could ever really get into the ship.  Thank you for saving the day, by the way."</p>

<p>There was a bottle of wine on the table and M upended it directly to her lips.  "I can't handle this right now," she said.  "I don't want to offend our hosts but if you stay I have to leave."</p>

<p>Q looked at the President and nodded.  "I should go," he said.  "I'm very sorry for all the trouble I've caused.  I hope I can make it up to you one day."</p>

<p>"So you cured his sociopathy," M said in a low growl that indicated she had no faith whatsoever that such a thing was possible.</p>

<p>"It was a relatively simple thing compared to curing your tendency to die," she replied.  "Habits are also a thing, and it took awhile for his consciousness to process what we did to him.  He didn't figure it out in time to save his friends, but they were all also wrestling with the same issue.  They did indeed leave a trap that could destroy our world, and we intended our treatment as punishment.  He is the one that got the message though.  He is a different human now, and further punishment would serve no purpose."</p>

<p>M took another deep gulp from the wine bottle.  "I'm going to take this back to our quarters," she said and lurched away from the table.  "You can do whatever you want, J.  Please make sure I don't encounter him again before we leave."</p>

<p>"We can arrange that," the President said as she left.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," I said.  "We've actually seen what happens to a world they do that to.  She risked everything to stop it from happening again at Kattegat.  She has no sense of humor about it."</p>

<p>"We do understand.  Remember that we operate a fold inhibitor for a reason.  Your own people came to us with demands we had to refuse."</p>

<p>My eyes flew open.  "Our people came to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they traced your route here somehow through the fold logs of the ship you flew the first time you visited us.  That is how Q was able to find you here."</p>

<p>"And what did our people do?"</p>

<p>"We had to remind them that we had driven off several invasion fleets over the course of our history, and while your technology is good it's not <em>that</em> good.  We have the high ground as long as we are protected by the fold inhibitor."</p>

<p>"Why did you offer Q sanctuary?"</p>

<p>"He poses no threat to us or to you, and we would not be who we are if we did not believe that experience could lead to redemption.  He is applying himself hard to the lessons we offer, and we believe that in time he will be an exemplary Witness."</p>

<p>"Is introducing him to us one of those lessons?"</p>

<p>"It could be," the President said.  "Then again, there could be a fortunate economy in that reintroducing him to you could also be a lesson for you."</p>

<p>"If so I don't think M got it."</p>

<p>"It can take time.  It took over a decade for Q to understand.  And for us there is no hurry."</p>

<p>Another wine bottle was brought, and I poured myself another glass.  "I am curious as to how you got our countrymen to back off.  I would expect them to build a chemical rocket and come here with nuclear weapons before backing down."</p>

<p>"We demonstrated that the fold inhibitor shutter allows us to use fold technology within our own domain while denying it to outsiders.  They could have mounted a devastating war against people sharing their limitations, but for practical purposes our defense is impregnable, and they recognized that.  We also put out feelers on Earth, where the Curators sometimes act as our agents.  We got the strong impression that their expedition was unauthorized and illegal and that nobody wanted to be caught with their pants down if it failed."</p>

<p>"The <em>Curators</em> act as <em>your</em> agents?"</p>

<p>"It's a mutual association.  We have different goals but have worked together for aeons."</p>

<p>I realized as I stood up that my chair was covered with hair.  "Fuck, I'm shedding," I said absently.</p>

<p>"That's okay," the President said.  "We have had vacuum cleaner technology since before the Curators whacked your homeworld with a planetoid to create its Moon."</p>

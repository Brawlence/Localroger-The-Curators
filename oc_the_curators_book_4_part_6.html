<p>The engineer who had recognized the rover's dialect patched it into a translator and made the relevant language selection.  It was a variant of Clacky intended for machines with no vocal tract.  It wasn't used much since most Curator machines capable of parsing Common were emulated consciousnesses, but it was used for control messages on the microfold network.  That's how our engineer had become familiar with it; he had helped to design our microfold system at the Pinwheel.</p>

<p>"Can we answer it?" Red asked.</p>

<p>"Presumably same technique on the same frequency.  What would you like to say?"</p>

<p>Red told him.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>WE SEEK TO LEARN ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO MADE YOU.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>YOU WILL FIND THEM ON THE SECONDMOST WORLD OUTWARD FROM THE SUN.</em></p>

<p>Red looked at me and I shrugged, knowing what he wanted to ask.  He spoke to the engineer.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>THERE ARE NO ROCKY WORLDS HERE ANY MORE.  THE INNERMOST WORLD IS A GAS GIANT.  THE CENTRAL STAR IS A WHITE DWARF AND WE BELIEVE YOU HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE BEFORE IT WAS EVEN A RED GIANT.</em></p>

<p>We had no idea if the machine could even understand this, but it surprised us.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>IMPRESSIVE.  IT IS UNFORTUNATE I CANNOT INFORM MY MAKERS OF THE LONGEVITY OF THEIR WARES.  IS THIS WHY THE DIAGNOSTICS FROM MY POWER UNIT MAKE NO SENSE?</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>YES, WE ARE POWERING YOU FROM AN EXTERNAL VOLTAGE SUPPLY.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>MY FUNCTION SEEMS OTHERWISE NOMINAL.  WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT MY ORIGIN?</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>YOU ARE MORE ADVANCED THAN THE MACHINES WE HAVE BUILT.  OUR ARTIFICIAL THOUGHT MACHINES ONLY UNDERSTAND VERY LIMITED CONCEPTS RELATED TO THEIR DESIGN PURPOSE.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>OF COURSE.  WE BUILT SUCH THINGS LONG AGO, BUT THEY WERE TOO LIMITED.  I AM AN EMULATION OF THE BIOLOGICAL THOUGHT MATRIX OF ONE OF MY CREATORS.</em></p>

<p>At that the room erupted in shouts and exclamations.  Red whistled loudly and everyone shut up.  He addressed the engineer running the translator.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>NOW THAT WE KNOW YOU ARE FUNCTIONAL WE NEED TO MAKE MORE DURABLE POWER ARRANGEMENTS.  IF WE REMOVE POWER WILL YOU RECOVER WITHOUT DAMAGE?</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>YES NEW ENGRAMS ARE COMMITTED IMMEDIATELY TO PERMANENT STORAGE.  I WILL DO A CONTROLLED SHUTDOWN ANYWAY TO ENSURE THAT IF YOU AWAKEN ME AGAIN I WILL REMEMBER THIS CONVERSATION AS MY LAST EXPERIENCE.  IF YOU CAN MAKE THE POWER ARRANGEMENT FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME TO STAND UP I WILL BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE MY INSTRUMENTS AND EFFECTORS, MOST OF WHICH WERE DESIGNED TO FACE THE GROUND I WAS EXPLORING.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>NOTED, WE WILL TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>READY FOR SHUTDOWN</em></p>

<p>The engineers pulled the plug and the room again erupted in cheers and shouts.</p>

<p><em>Three Weeks Later</em></p>

<p>We continued our explorations but we would never find another artifact as advanced or as intact as the rover.  We debated constantly how to approach the inevitable reawakening.  Improving our communication channel was the simplest of considerations.</p>

<p>"We have to decide how much to tell it before we wake it up," Red insisted.  "It has probably guessed that the red giant took out its home, but it doesn't know their manufactory at the neutron star survived that and that we destroyed it."</p>

<p>"For that matter we've been told that modern Curators were a splinter group who might be very different from the others of their race who built the rover, and that they destroyed the homeworld before the red giant got around to doing it."</p>

<p>"It also doesn't seem to know about the fold.  It might also predate what was later built at the neutron star."</p>

<p>"We don't know that," I said.  "We've had one very short conversation with it.  It obviously knows about personality emulation, and in our time that requires the microfold."</p>

<p>"The Curators do it that way because they <em>have</em> the microfold.  There are other possibilities.  In any case we could learn a lot from it."</p>

<p>"We actually don't know how much of its own culture or science it knows about other than what it needed to explore a space rock.  Curator implants don't carry any knowledge of exactly <em>how</em> they're doing personality emulation."</p>

<p>We prepared a large room with an umbilical suspended from the ceiling so that it could rove over an area of a few dozen square meters.  We drafted the engineer who had recognized its language to work out a better way to engage in communications.</p>

<p>We would not want a large audience in attendance because we needed to carefully control what it learned about modern reality.  If it got pissed off at us we had no way to make it forget, and a <em>lot</em> had happened since it was abandoned.</p>

<p>When we reawakened it only Red, the engineer who had recognized its language, and I were in the room.  We had installed automation to improve our communication and a screen to display our conversation in written Galactic Common.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>WELCOME BACK</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>ONCE AGAIN MY FUNCTION SEEMS NOMINAL.  IS IT SAFE FOR ME TO RISE?</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>YES YOUR POWER FEED IS FLEXIBLE AND SHOULD ALLOW YOU TO MOVE</em> [several meters].</p>

<p>We actually had to translate the distance into Curator units based on the wavelength of the hydrogen line, and we were mildly surprised when it seemed to understand.  It slowly unfolded its legs, first rotating them high over its body and extending them fore and aft, then opening them at the knee to scissor itself up to a standing position.  The whole process took several minutes.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>MY ACTUATORS WERE DESIGNED FOR RELIABILITY IN VACUUM RATHER THAN SPEED</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>THAT THEY FUNCTION AT ALL TODAY INDICATES EXCELLENT DESIGN</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>INDEED.  I WILL DEPLOY SOME INSTRUMENTS.</em></p>

<p>Several devices released and hinged down from the bottom of its body.  One of these was very obviously a camera and it did a slow 360-degree scan of the room; when it had completed the circle it returned to point directly at us.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>HAVE I CORRECTLY ACQUIRED YOU, THREE UPRIGHT LIVING BEINGS?</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>YES</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>CONSIDERING THE TIME ELAPSED YOU REMARKABLY RESEMBLE MY MAKERS.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>WE WISH WE COULD SEE WHAT YOUR MAKERS LOOKED LIKE</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>I CAN ACCOMMODATE.</em></p>

<p>Another instrument swung down and faced to our side.  Bright colored lines appeared on the wall, and this instrument also did a full room scan.  Then it pointed toward an area of the wall by our side.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>THIS INSTRUMENT WAS BUILT TO PROJECT PATTERNED LIGHT FOR TERRAIN NAVIGATION BUT IT CAN ALSO FUNCTION AS AN IMAGE PROJECTOR.</em></p>

<p>It took several seconds to build a raster-scanned image of about a dozen aliens standing behind the machine and in front of a banner.  The written language was very distorted Common but one of the words was very definitely "team."</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT ME.</em></p>

<p>The aliens were humanoid, hairless with smooth dark skin and wearing jumpsuit style uniforms that covered most of their bodies.  A circle was drawn around one face.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>THIS INDIVIDUAL IS MY THOUGHT-MATRIX ANCESTOR.  I BEGAN WITH ITS MEMORIES AND SKILLS.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>HOW DID THEY SCAN YOUR THOUGHT MATRIX?</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>IT IS A DESTRUCTIVE PROCEDURE BUT MY ANCESTOR WAS OLD AND IN POOR HEALTH AND READY TO CONTRIBUTE SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE A THOUGHT MATRIX WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROJECT.  WAITING FOR NATURAL DEATH RESULTS IN A DISTORTED SCAN SO THE SUBJECT IS EUTHANIZED WITH PRESERVATIVE CHEMICALS, FROZEN, THEN SCANNED LAYER BY LAYER AS THE BRAIN IS DISASSEMBLED.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>HOW DID YOUR PEOPLE LEARN TO EMULATE A MIND BASED ON SUCH A SCAN?</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>WE HAVE KNOWN THAT FOR</em> [untranslateable]. <em>IN MY TIME THOUGHT MATRIX EMULATION WAS THE BASIS FOR ALL OF OUR AUTOMATION.</em></p>

<p>The picture of the team disappeared and was replaced with a block diagram; this was a simpler figure so it drew quickly.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>OUR IMMATURE CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT THE FUNDAMENTAL ORGANIZATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH IS COMMON TO NEARLY ALL ANIMAL LIFE AS WE KNEW IT.  ARE THESE DIAGRAMS NOT FAMILIAR?</em></p>

<p>The first diagram was replaced by what seemed to be a zoom into one of the functional blocks.  "Are you recording this?" I asked Red.</p>

<p>"Every goddamn pixel," he replied.  He signaled to the comms guy.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>SOME OF IT IS FAMILIAR.  THE BLOCKS ON THE FIRST DIAGRAM SEEM TO CONFORM TO COMMON MAJOR BRAIN STRUCTURES.  AND WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE COMPRISED OF MANY REPEATED FUNCTIONAL UNITS BUT WE DO NOT KNOW JUST HOW THEY WORK.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>I WILL SHOW YOU THE ENTIRE SET THEN.  YOU MAY FIND IT INSTRUCTIVE.</em></p>

<p>"You have no idea," Red said aloud in English.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>WE WERE SURPRISED AT HOW SIMPLE IT ALL IS WHEN IT IS FULLY UNDERSTOOD.  IT HAS A SELF-SIMILAR STRUCTURE WHOSE DEPTH VARIES FROM SPECIES TO SPECIES BUT ON OUR WORLD WAS DEEPEST IN OURSELVES, EXPLAINING OUR TECHNOLOGY AND FUTURE PLANNING SKILL.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>HOW MANY OF YOUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SCANNED?</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>MY MAKERS HAVE SCANNED LESS THAN ONE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS SINCE THEY DEVELOPED THE SKILL BUT THE MATRICES CAN BE USED IN MANY DIFFERENT MACHINES.  THERE WERE AT LEAST TWENTY SPACE PROBES PLANNED TO CARRY THIS THOUGHT MATRIX AND THERE WERE PLANS TO DEVELOP A DIFFERENT VERSION OPTIMIZED TO MANAGE RESEARCH PROJECTS.  SOME OF THE OLDER MATRICES HAVE BEEN COPIED INTO BILLIONS OF DEVICES.</em></p>

<p>"Don't the Curators have a taboo against that?" Red asked me.</p>

<p>"They most definitely do," I said.</p>

<p>Red signaled the comms guy and he said, "are you sure?"  Red nodded.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>DO YOU MISS HAVING A LIVING BODY?</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>SUCH AN EMOTION WOULD MAKE ME UNSUITABLE FOR MY DUTIES.  WE HAVE THE SKILL TO EDIT THE THOUGHT MATRIX TO REMOVE SUCH DISTRACTIONS AND TO SUPPLEMENT FUNCTIONALITY.</em></p>

<p>Presently the thought matrix slide show stopped.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>CAN THE POWER ARRANGEMENT ACCOMMODATE A WALKING TEST IN A CIRCLE OF</em> [two meters] <em>RADIUS?</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>YES, PROCEED AT ANY TIME</em></p>

<p>The rover walked forward.  It took about ten minutes to complete the circle during which it also deployed and re-stowed several other instruments.  It returned to its original position within millimeters.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>OTHER THAN THE ABSENT POWER SOURCE I SEEM TO BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL.  IT IS CURIOUS THOUGH THAT THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD HERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE CONSTANT.  THERE IS A REGULAR VARIATION OF ABOUT FIVE PARTS IN ONE THOUSAND OVER A DISTANCE PERIOD OF</em> [thirty centimeters].</p>

<p>"Gravity plating," I said.  "Should we tell it?"  Red nodded.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>WE ARE ON A SPACE VESSEL AND THAT IS AN ARTIFACT OF THE ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY SYSTEM.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>CURIOUS INDEED.  YOU DO NOT HAVE WHAT WE CONSIDER A BASIC TECHNOLOGY OF THOUGHT MATRIX EMULATION YET YOU HAVE ARTIFICIAL GRAVITY.  DOES THIS USE A TECHNIQUE THAT BENDS SPACE TO HARVEST PARTICLES FROM A REMOTE LOCATION?  IT OCCURS TO ME THAT YOU MUST ALSO HAVE SOME KIND OF TRAVEL THAT ALLOWED YOU TO REACH THIS SYSTEM FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE, MOST LIKELY THE MAIN GALACTIC DISK, AND SUCH A TECHNOLOGY WOULD SUFFICE FOR THAT TOO.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>CORRECT</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>WE HAD A THEORETICAL DESCRIPTION OF SUCH A TECHNOLOGY BUT THERE WAS A RISK OF DESTROYING ONE OF OUR WORLDS SHOULD WE GET IT WRONG IN EXPERIMENT.</em></p>

<p>Red typed a message and showed it to me.  I nodded, and when the comms guy read it he nodded too.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>YOUR MAKERS EVENTUALLY DID THAT EXPERIMENT.  THEY CAME TO THE MAIN GALACTIC DISK LONG AGO AND MADE MANY HABITABLE WORLDS AND SEEDED THEM WITH LIFE.  WE ARE THE PRODUCTS OF THAT PROJECT.</em></p>

<p>The rover was silent for several seconds.  Then...</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>WE HAVE MUCH TO LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER.</em></p>

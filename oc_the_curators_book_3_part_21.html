<p>I was now a card-carrying member of the powerful and secretive Plasma, who worked invisibly even to most Curators to shape the Curator plan for their garden.  Actually I didn't have a card, but I did have a microfold recognition token my implant could broadcast, which allowed those I had thought of as political officers to recognize one another.  And that's what I became.  </p>

<p>Once they accepted me I detected almost no pushback against my claims to fervor for their cause.  They understood the need for secrecy, but had little appreciation for the finer points of spycraft.  As with the hacking of computers, it seems that the need for us to engage with our own kind forced humans to develop spycraft to a much finer art than anyone else ever had.  And I had learned those techniques from Veronica and her colleagues in the course of hunting Nemesis.</p>

<p>The Plasma leaders returned to their base worlds, which was bothersome because I wasn't able to learn where most of them were.  Just as the Curators were spread thinly throughout the population of the galaxy, the Plasma were spread thinly throughout the galactic population of Curators except for a few concentrations like the crew of station C.</p>

<p>My role was basically to be a consultant and cheerleader, and I made a show of immersing myself in all things Plan with the ferver of a new convert.  I loudly complained about our lack of resources capable of doing anything substantive about the humans at M101 until after a couple of months one of the others finally decided I needed to be in the loop.  She opened a carry pouch and produced a silver ball that was almost comically identical in form to Callie's orgasm balls.</p>

<p>"It takes thousands of Earth years to make an implant, and tens of thousands to make an amplifier, but the Manufactory can make one of these in a little more than one year.  And we have hundreds of stations at work making them simultaneously."</p>

<p>"What does it do?"</p>

<p>"It destroys worlds."</p>

<p>"The humans have defenses against that."</p>

<p>"Not this.  This destroys worlds without making an abnormal fold.  It looks exactly like a ship coming in, but it's fully automated and what actually comes in is a slug pulled from the core of the nearest star."</p>

<p>I let her explain to me exactly what that meant, even though I knew that already.  Most people would not believe just how violent the center of a star is, or what a fold ship sized blob of solar corium could do to a planet from near-GEO orbit.</p>

<p>"We destroyed their beachhead world," she said with an air of some pride, and it took all my self-control to suppress the urge to strangle her on the spot.</p>

<p>I pressed her carefully and realized that there had been no follow-up and they didn't know that Terminus was being reinhabited, or that the defense networks would now neutralize their new toys.  They had conducted a single test and decided it was good.  They were in for a big surprise when they launched phase two of their brilliant plan.</p>

<p>"The Manufactory -- that must be a pretty amazing place," I said.</p>

<p>She held out her hand to take back her solar bomb.  "It is, and its location is one of our most precious secrets.  There is knowledge locked up in our implants that few of us are allowed to access because it is so dangerous.  But the Manufactory holds secrets too dangerous even for that level of security.  It is the only place in the galaxy that could make a thing like this.  And it has been the jewel of our productive capacity for nearly seven billion Earth years."</p>

<p>"When will we be ready to launch more attacks?" I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Another year or so.  We want to have enough of these to bomb their entire operation at the Pinwheel to slag in one strike, and we didn't start making them in sufficient quantity until the destruction of their beachhead was demonstrated.  We might let the remnants at Earth live if they have no threatening productive capacity left."</p>

<p>"You should kill them too," I said because it's what the character I was playing would demand.</p>

<p>"You'll get a chance to make your case on that, and you might prevail," she said.  "You've been quite vocal about your worry.  I wanted you to know that all is not yet lost."</p>

<p>"Well I'm glad to know that," I said with real sincerity because I was indeed very glad to know where they stood.</p>

<p>I pretended to be satisfied and went about my business of loudly advocating for the destruction of Earth along with all the new human colonies.  Then after a few months I went back to the Plasma agent who showed me the solar bomb.  "I've been thinking," I said, "and I am puzzled by something.  You said the goal was to destroy all the Pinwheel colonies in one stroke, which I think is perfect, but I can't figure out how you will do that.  Do we have enough agents and enough platforms for them to operate from?"</p>

<p>"That's the brilliant thing," she said proudly.  "Unlike the first prototypes, the new weapons being made now will be able to fold themselves to their targets.  All we need to do is bring the lot of them to a definite point anywhere in the galaxy, and they will all make way to their targets independently and wait for the appointed time to strike.  We only need one small ship, and we've already built it.  Follow."  I fold-followed her and found myself on the bridge of a vessel that was eerily remniscent of the one Callie had piloted during her career scouting DENT worlds.</p>

<p>"Just ten bioform crew," she said.  "They precisely deploy the solar bombs one at a time with an automatic release mechanism, and then return here.  We have made the voyage to the Pinwheel with this ship several times already.  We still haven't precisely located most of their worlds but we have some time to do that before the weapons are ready to deploy."</p>

<p>"How are you going about finding their worlds?"</p>

<p>"We have made more human-form Curators by taking infant human hosts.  They have no way to detect the presence of an implant and we've learned to be careful about what we reveal as we mature.  These new agents are traveling the Pinwheel pretending to be settlers, taking readings at each world they visit."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be easier if you just had the humans' own index of their worlds?"</p>

<p>"It would, but we don't have access to it or to the basis of their navigational coordinate system."</p>

<p>"That's because your agents are <em>young</em> humans.  My mission was to insinuate myself with the nexuses of human power, and that's what I've done.  I know many powerful humans personally, and have known some of those ruling now for over a hundred years.  They trust me.  I can reappear, tell whatever agency I need to contact that I was doing a shadow job for a different one -- they don't communicate among one another and I'm very familiar with <em>how</em> they don't communicate -- and oh by the way I need some access.  I can actually <em>get</em> that access.  It's exactly what I've been doing for thousands of years."</p>

<p>"What are you proposing?"</p>

<p>"I go back among them.  Get the definition of their coordinate system and their index of worlds.  Bring it back so you can cross-reference with what you've learned separately.  Save a bunch of legwork finishing the job you've started.  Wipe the fuckers out sooner."</p>

<p>"There are some people I need to talk to," she said.  "I'll get back to you."</p>

<p>Two weeks later she got back to me.  "Your plan is a go," she said.  "Our human agents can't commute between the galaxies without arousing too much suspicion, and it's difficult for us to find and communicate with them at the Pinwheel ourselves.  You could greatly accelerate our project if you can pull this off."</p>

<p>"I'll make short work of it," I promised.</p>

<p>"It is looking like it will take years at the rate we're going even if we recruit more human-form Curators.  We will have the weapons long before we know where to use them.  We need to be sure our coverage is complete because a partial attack would leave them in a position to rebuild."</p>

<p>"I can fix that," I said very definitely.</p>

<p>"That would be excellent.  Please do."</p>

<p>As the <em>Limiting Factor</em> approached Terminus I didn't wait for it to land.  I contacted Emma via the microfold and folded myself directly from station orbit to a private room in the royal palace.  I raised my hand and let her have the whole story of my mission.  It took her a few minutes to fully absorb.  Then she said "Wow.  They aren't fucking around."</p>

<p>"No," I agreed.  "By the way, where's Jay?"</p>

<p>"He's on Earth.  We agreed that one of us should probably always be here but that <em>both</em> of us should probably hardly <em>ever</em> be here at the same time."</p>

<p>"That sounds prudent, but not too easy on your relationship."</p>

<p>"We're a very, very old married couple, Andrew.  We'll deal with it.  He will be here for a few days next month and I'll update him if you haven't already, and I'll fold off to survey newly opened DENT worlds.  Meanwhile, we have to figure out what to do about this fleet of solar bombs."</p>

<p>"I must admit I like the idea of feeding them false information, so that all of their bombs go off on the wrong side of the solar system.  Let everyone know what they tried to do and make it a total failure at the same time."</p>

<p>"That's not workable though.  We don't know how much real information they are getting from their agents among us, and even if they totally fell for it they'd then have enough information to try again and get it right in a couple of years."</p>

<p>I sighed.  "Yes, I did realize that."</p>

<p>"We have to attack their Manufactory," she said.  "It sounds pretty definite that they only have one, and if we can take it down they may not have the offsite knowledge any longer to rebuild it, at least quickly."</p>

<p>"The problem with that is that nobody seems to know where it is.  Like really nobody.  I dealt with some people who should have at least been <em>close</em> to people who knew, but nobody knew <em>anything</em> except that it is really, really remote and well-hidden.  But nobody had any idea as to <em>how</em> remote or <em>how</em> it was hidden.  They all seemed pretty confident that it isn't in another galaxy, because implants and amplifiers have to be able to make way to and from it -- and I suppose the solar bombs have to too.  But is it at the center of the galaxy, between the arms, in a globular cluster, in plain sight near some populous indexed world?  People felt free to speculate because there was no dangerous intel being disclosed if we did."</p>

<p>"But implants must know how to get to it so they can recycle."</p>

<p>"Implants know a lot of things their owners don't know.  We don't know what else is in there that Jay's brush with the emergency protocol might <em>not</em> have unlocked.  Obviously implants can also back up and restore bioform personalities but they don't seem to contain any practical information on the theory of <em>how</em> they're doing it.  And the nature of the problem means we may figure it out for ourselves before we reverse engineer their solution."</p>

<p>"But we have one that you've been drilling holes in for years.  There must be a map in there somewhere."</p>

<p>"There obviously is, but it may be encoded in such a way that you don't know where step two is until you've completed step one, and step one might not even look like what you think you're looking for and it's buried in a quadrillion bits of spaghetti representing other things.  The Curators haven't developed cryptography as far as humans, but they've had much better computing power for a very long time."</p>

<p>"How long do you have here?" she asked.</p>

<p>"They were talking a bit less than an Earth year until the weapons would be ready.  I had to offer them something attractively better to make sure they'd go for my offer, so I suggested it would take me a few months to gather the information they need.  Much longer than that and my continued absence will become suspicious."</p>

<p>"Well at least that gives us some time to figure out what to do."</p>

<p>"I just hope it's <em>enough</em> time," I said.</p>

<p>At Earth I began by seeking out the Curator who had given me the prototype death orb 
and led me to the Plasma.  He was visibly annoyed to find me waiting for him in his
flat but before he could voice his objection I held up my hand.  He sighed and motioned
to receive my vision, and I gave him the same show I'd given the Homeless.</p>

<p>As he absorbed it he sat down heavily on his other chair.  "They would all have been
there," he said.  "They were incredibly afraid of going anywhere else and getting the
worm."</p>

<p>"They were planning to begin deployment."</p>

<p>"Essentially self-isolation," he said.  "There are too few Curators at the human galaxies to
spread the disease to them.  And the leaders wouldn't be going.  There's no way for the implants
to return to this galaxy and find new hosts if they destroy everything in another galaxy at
the same time.  Those agents were being sacrificed."</p>

<p>"Most of them weren't told that."</p>

<p>"Typical."</p>

<p>"My agent gave me two lists of Earth exile Curators.  One was of suspected counter agents.
You were on it."</p>

<p>"Not surprising.  The other list?"</p>

<p>"Their agents here."</p>

<p>"Can you show it to me?"</p>

<p>I held up my hand and gave it to him.</p>

<p>"That's all the leadership I know of," he said nodding.  "There are others who call themselves
Plasma but they will weathervane toward new leaders of other persuasions without these 
individuals to shepherd them."</p>

<p>"You've been most helpful," I said.  "There is something I should have told you a long time
ago.  You are immune to the fold-following worm.  I gave you this immunity when you gave
me the prototype death ball."</p>

<p>"You expect me to believe this?"</p>

<p>I held out my hand to invite physical contact and said, "Trust me."</p>

<p>Hesitantly, he accepted my handshake.  A moment later we were on the Moon, taking in the
scenic view of Earth low on the horizon across the Bay of Rainbows from a peak in the Jura
Mountains.</p>

<p>The air whistling out of our lungs made spoken speech impossible but our native microfold
senses kicked in.  "But the inhibitor!" he sent with maximum emphasis.  "How?!"</p>

<p>"I have an amplifier," I sent back, and after a few more moments to appreciate the view
I folded us back to Earth, but not to his dingy flat.  Instead I took him to the Gateway
shuttle terminal.</p>

<p>"There is nothing out there that can hurt you now, and much work to be done," I said.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about the Plasma leadership?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am going to kill them all," I said coolly.</p>

<p>"Just like that?"</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"Well.  In that case there really won't be anything more needing my attention <em>here</em>."
And he walked into the terminal building toward the departure schedule display.</p>

<hr />

<p>"It would have been easier to do this if you had kept our friend around.  It's very
hard to move inconspicuously among the exile Curators as a human, especially the ones
who embrace antihuman fanaticism," Veronica chided.</p>

<p>"He was on their list of suspect Curators," I said.  "He wouldn't have been any less
conspicuous than us, and I have the enhanced capabilities."</p>

<p>"You can sense implant ID's, but the list doesn't give those.  Curators can't sense
each others' ID's and generally don't even know their own."</p>

<p>"They do have the combination of uplift world and sequence number they use when they
need to uniquely identify themselves.  That's in the newer security layers and
normally hidden, but it can be read both by the implant owner and by others with
sufficient security access.  That's how Curators with privileges within a group
keep track of their members, and those codes are on the list.  And I can read them
remotely with the level 2 access code."</p>

<p>"How did I have an implant for all those years and not know about this?"</p>

<p>"You never had a need to use it but you were 1742660:9.  Jay and Emma were 7 and 8.
I made Helen 1742660:10 even though she got the implant on Deucalion because that isn't
a Curator world and it doesn't have an index."</p>

<p>"What prevents collisions?"</p>

<p>"Nothing except discipline.  There's usually an individual responsible for assignments
on each indexed world.  It's unusual for any world to have more than a couple of dozen
such native Curators and of course we all know one another.  And it can always be 
updated; unlike the implant ID the uplift sequence changes when we take a new host."</p>

<p>"How close do you have to get to sense this ID?"</p>

<p>"About half a klick.  I can start the new worm download if I can sense the ID."</p>

<p>"There will be a hell of a lot of Curators within that radius in one of the enclaves."</p>

<p>"Fortunately the ID makes it targeted.  I don't want anyone except our designated
targets to get what I'm preparing."</p>

<p>"And what <em>are</em> you preparing?"</p>

<p>"What Helen did to the Plasma, with extra benefits.  Fortunately she gave me the 
code for her exploit in her departing info blast."</p>

<hr />

<p>Like Helen's worm mine was injected through the highest level of security and quietly
installed the groundwork for doing its damage quickly when I broadcast the trigger.
There was no need to give them warning and let the uninfected get twitchy.</p>

<p>When it received the trigger the worm would disable fold following, but also voluntary
folding and voluntary microfold communication.  It would leave them trapped on
Earth with no way to call for help.  </p>

<p>Even before the trigger was pulled the worm would also create an <em>involuntary</em> beacon
that would send their location to me after receiving either a broadcast or targeted
ping.  Once they were infected they wouldn't be able to hide.</p>

<p>The only problem was finding them all.  I needed to be within a few hundred meters to
match them to the list ID's, and there were Curator enclaves all over the Earth.
While I was hunting them down I stationed my amplifier at the Gateway shuttle 
terminal so it could alert me if any of them seemed to be leaving Earth.  As it
turned out, none of them tried.</p>

<p>There were two hundred and seventy individuals on the list, and it took us nearly a
year to find them all.  It would have taken five years without Veronica's experience
dealing with the exile community.</p>

<p>On July 4, 3026 A.D. Veronica and I met for martinis at the Top of the Mark.  She
asked me about each name on the list and I was able to say exactly when and where
that individual had received the new worm.  When we agreed our work was complete,
I tossed back the last of my drink and sent the signal.</p>

<p>"What happens now?" Veronica asked.</p>

<p>"All hell breaks loose."</p>

<hr />

<p>About once a day I used the broadcast location ping to map where they all were.  The
thing they would all immediately notice was the silence of their microfold comms.
They would not find out about folding until they got out of the inhibitor field, but
they would have to be worried.  There was a great deal of movement in the first few
days and I was able to start rounding them up.</p>

<p>I recalled my amplifier from the Gateway shuttle terminal because Gateway was now a
dead end for them.  They couldn't fold themselves away and if they took a ship 
they'd lose their implants.</p>

<p>The amplifier gave me a fold range within the inhibitor of a bit less than an 
astronomical unit, and less than a tenth of that with the payload of another 
typical bioform.  Fortunately those limits were more than generous enough for me
to execute my plan.</p>

<p>One by one I read their immediate location, folded in behind them, grabbed their
shoulders or whatever anatomical part was equally appropriate, and folded them off
to the lunar crater I'd decided to designate as their mass open grave.  You might 
think that would have gotten a bit monotonous, but I took a savage joy in ridding 
the galaxy of these assholes once and for all.  I could have done it more quickly 
but I took a few moments to watch each of them understand how fucked they were when 
they realized they were on an airless moon with no implant and no way to escape.
Each of them would have fifteen or twenty minutes to appreciate the view of the Earth
before their vacuum defenses lost the ability to keep them conscious.  I made sure to
give each of them time to expire before showing up with another, so it 
took me about a month to take care of them all.</p>

<p>Word spread quickly of course among the Plasma loyalists that their comrades were 
disappearing, and those I hadn't got to became more and more frantic
in their attempts to evade me.  As their numbers dwindled a few of them even resorted
to the absolute last chance hail Mary of voluntarily ditching their implants.  Alas,
the worm had disabled those functions too, and they could neither abandon their implant
to live on as mortals nor burn their bioform to retire into emulation.  They could have
cheated me by destroying their bioform by more conventionally suicidal means, but none
of them thought of that.</p>

<p>It was amusing to see the increasingly desperate measures they did resort to running
about the world as I went about my work.  A couple of dozen of them even went to
Gateway, and I let them.  This was another way a few of them might have lived; had
they taken a fold ship they would have lost their implants but not their bioforms.
But they all eventually came back to Earth and subsequently joined their comrades 
on the Moon.</p>

<p>When every ID on the list was crossed out Veronica and I met for another round of
martinis.</p>

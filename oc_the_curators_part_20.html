<p>The technicians fanned out to begin their tasks with quiet confidence; they weren't being shot at and they had a well-defined job to complete.  There were other aliens present of varous form, all of whom turned out to actually be Curators, who assisted and began suggesting modifications, which the technicians carefully considered.</p>

<p>"The inhibitor itself is basic silicon substrate and by design redundant," our human-form Curator told us.  "But your power supplies use some components which might not have the longevity we seek.  Fortunately we have the technology at hand to bypass those and power the silicon directly."</p>

<p>"Where's the power coming from?"</p>

<p>"Photovoltaic nanite network on the surface with a storage layer for the lunar night.  It's still knitting out but should be done before nightfall, and it's already adequate for direct power in the day."</p>

<p>Unlike the technicians who were nodding and pointing to connection points, M and I had no real idea why we were there.  New Curators of different form popped in and out from time to time and after an hour or so a Sevillian appeared.</p>

<p>"Also one of ours," our Curator said before we could ask.  "Greetings old friend <em>scree</em>."</p>

<p>"And yourself.  I haven't seen you since you helped us get these guys through the path."</p>

<p>"You worked on the Seville project?" M asked our Curator.</p>

<p>"Oh yes.  In that day I walked among them as <em>scree</em> here does now.  Quite a different experience."</p>

<p>"Senses are senses," the Sevillian form Curator said.  "And in this case, senseless is senseless."</p>

<p>"It is also a pun in Sevillian," our Curator said to M and me.  "So what's it like down there?"</p>

<p>"Nobody knows about it.  The xenocide project has been kept under a tight lid of secrecy by those who moved it forward.  Many of the acts they performed to get it done were obviously criminal under Sevillian law.  The resources they diverted to create the death drones have already created an economic recession and many people have been trying to figure out why it's happening."</p>

<p>"Well they're about to find out."</p>

<p>"Maybe what we're doing here is a little harsh," I suggested.</p>

<p>"We have discussed this at our highest levels all across the galaxy," the Sevillian said.  "An example must be made."</p>

<p>"Do they have any assets off-system?"</p>

<p>"Not many, both of their remaining fold ships are in orbit now.  They have a few individuals on other worlds but not enough to establish a stable colony, should anyone even let them try."</p>

<p>We consulted with the technicians.  The conversion and installation was almost complete.  The human built power supplies and control panel had been completely bypassed; the inhibitor would be activated by a timer of Curator design.  </p>

<p>"Are all our people off-world?"</p>

<p>"Actually a lot of them have elected to stay.  We have made sure they understand there will be no back door past the inhibitor, but this is also galactic history being made and they want to bear witness.  And the expected blackout duration isn't that long for us."</p>

<p>"How long are you going to shut them out?"</p>

<p>"Long enough to make an impression.  Their grand council is in session.  I think it's about time to crash it.  Humans, if you don't mind?"  He extended his hands, and M and I each took one.  Moments later we were in an auditorium full of Sevillians obviously engaged in the business of state.  M and I were hearing translation even though we weren't wearing obvious translation hardware.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this?" one Sevillian shouted.  "Who are these aliens and how have they appeared in our chamber?"</p>

<p>"We have come to judge you," the Sevillian Curator said and while the translation was calm the original sounds it was making boomed through the chamber.</p>

<p>"Guards!"</p>

<p>"The doors won't open!"</p>

<p>Six Sevillians advanced on us with weapons drawn.  Our Curators looked at one another and waved their arms, and the weapons dissolved into dust.</p>

<p>"I did not know you could do that," I muttered.</p>

<p>"We couldn't do it to <em>you</em>," our human-form Curator muttered back.  "But you know how your people have been wondering if we put back doors into the nanite technology?  Now you know."</p>

<p>One of the representatives slowly approached us as everyone else was backing away, and I realized it was my original contact K, who had once made an appointment with a well-known but not very space savvy human dermatologist.  "Not possible," K said.  "What manner of trickery is this.  Are you human J?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, as the chamber went quiet.  It was a riot of color as the representatives reacted to the situation and their dermis announced their feelings.</p>

<p>"YOU ARE DEAD!"  K shouted.  It looked at M.  "And you!  And you!  <em>HOW ARE YOU HERE?</em>"</p>

<p>"That is what we are here to explain.  How many of your colleagues know of these?"  Above our heads a holographic display appeared of the two death drones at station.  There was much muttering in the chamber.</p>

<p>"You know what they are," I said to K.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," it spat.  "You excreted on the equilibrium of our galaxy.  You rewarded our enemies with powerful technology and brought them to our door.  You are spreading through the unclaimed worlds of our galaxy like vermin.  We did what was necessary."</p>

<p>"What did you do?" several voices said from the gallery.</p>

<p>"We exterminated the vermin," K said.  "These will be among the last of their kind.  As it should be."</p>

<p>"They made a realization they thought was quite clever, but like almost everything it's not as new as they thought," the Curator said.  "A fold drive whose <em>only</em> purpose is to detune and fold a planet into its star does not need to be manned to perfect its calibration.  So they built two dedicated planet-killing drones, and sent one to Earth and the other to Kattegat, the homeworld of those you call the raiders."  </p>

<p>"And how did they fund this murderous extravagance?"</p>

<p>"You will probably find that much of it was illegal, and has caused your current economic downturn."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," K spat.  "We did what had to be done."</p>

<p>"And you failed," M said.  "Our team stopped you at Earth, and J and I ambushed your ship <em>Rate of Change</em> and destroyed it before it could deliver the other drone to Kattegat."</p>

<p>"Lies!  We have the sunlight cannon now."  At this a gasp went up from the chamber.  "Your ships have hulls of gossamer, how could you possibly prevail against one of our capital ships?"</p>

<p>"We didn't use the sunlight cannon.  We used a hydrogen bomb."  The Curators helpfully put up a projected image of the <em>Rate of Change</em> with its blown-off apex and the ominous glow from within.  Another gasp from the chamber.</p>

<p>"YOU ARE ABOMINATIONS!" K shouted, and several Sevillians came forward to restrain it before it could attack us.</p>

<p>"We created you," the Sevillian-form Curator said to the chamber.  "We formed your world from the cosmic dust, gave it a moon and the right conditions for life to thrive.  We seeded your world with life and we guided it, forming your tree of life and your genus and your ancestral species.  We gave you encouragement to evolve intelligence and in time language and writing and science and technology.  We gave you nanites and the fold drive.  And you have thanked us for our gifts by using them to try to murder our other children."</p>

<p>There was a ripple in the chamber as someone with obvious authority descended from the audience to the dais.  "Your power is obvious," it said.  "Most of us did not know of this transgression which was done in our name.  What are your intentions?"</p>

<p>"The last time this happened was over a billion years ago," the Sevillian-form Curator said.  "In that case it started a planet-folding war.  We had to end it by folding twenty worlds into their stars ourselves, to fully cure the disease."</p>

<p>"We will do whatever we can to atone."</p>

<p>"You have the humans to thank for the fact that you are still alive.  They have given us a new option.  There will be hardship, but your kind will have a second chance."</p>

<p>"I know my people will ask why we are being punished, but not those of Kattegat who did fold one of your worlds into its sun."</p>

<p>"That was the act of a desperate crew who were surprised by an existential threat they did not expect.  And the world they folded did not harbor a critical path species or post critical path civilization.  Their leaders were horrified to learn of what happened and quickly instructed their space captains to make sure it must never happen again.  And the humans exercised mercy, and without our encouragement decided to rectify the problem by solving the problem that made the raiders become raiders in the first place, their starvation for raw materials, rather than exacting revenge.  Meanwhile, even though you had never even been attacked your leaders devoted significant resources to the purpose of xenocide.  They had not been surprised and knew just what they were doing."</p>

<p>"In that case, we gratefully accept your decision to grant us a second chance.  May I ask just what our hardship will be, and for how long?"</p>

<p>"You will find out its form soon enough.  As for the duration, we will see if a thousand of your years gives you time to reflect on what was done in your name."</p>

<p>As M and I were still sucking in our breath our Curator grabbed our hands and suddenly we were back on Seville's moon, where all the human technicians and aliens were gone.  The Curator activated a control panel and motioned for our hands again, saying "Quickly!"  Moments later we were on a transparent glass surface elevated far above a desert landscape.</p>

<p>"My mother brought me here when I was a child," M said.  "The Grand Canyon Skywalk, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  My people have a saying that when you have to do something ugly, you should remind yourself of something beautiful.  Your people made this bridge purely for the purpose of celebrating the beauty of the world we gave you.  This would have been lost if the Sevillians had succeeded in their plan."</p>

<p>"It was just a few of them," I said.</p>

<p>"It only takes a few, and a lot more supporting and following them blindly, as your people learned over time.  It's a terrible thing that it happened, but your people know genocide.  The Sevillians don't.  They are still able to think of it as a cleansing process.  But as violent as humans can be, you have also learned the hard way just how much so much blood costs.  You applied the same lesson to the raiders that you have applied to your own nations in recent time and we are quite proud of you."</p>

<p>We watched as the Sun sank toward the horizon.  "How do we know the Sevillians will learn the same thing from their millenium of exile?"</p>

<p>"Oh we don't," he said as the twilight deepened.  "But if they don't, there is always still plan A."</p>

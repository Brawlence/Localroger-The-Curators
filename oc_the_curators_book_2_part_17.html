<p>The Red Estate was not far from the new capital city of Earth, in the Australian badlands.  The man who liked to call himself the Red Prince had moved there from Montana when it became clear his already considerable interests were at risk in the forming Russo-American Concordance.  He was one of the largest shareholders of the company that ended up making the first human fold drives, and he was still one of the richest individuals on Earth.  We had been careful not to disrupt such fortunes as his when the governments were unified because, if they acted together, those few hundred people could have made our mission very difficult.  Instead we assured them that their interests would be safer than ever absent the squabbling of nation-states and they welcomed the change we brought.</p>

<p>We didn't bother concealing our arrival.  At his direction we folded directly into a luxurious great room within his sprawling estate.</p>

<p>"My King and Queen," he said with a modest and possibly a bit sarcastic bow.  "I must say I expected silver tights and royal headwear."</p>

<p>"We aren't here on official business of the Earth government.  Thank you for agreeing to see us."</p>

<p>"I have several friends who strenuously advised me to do whatever you want.  They had to hitchhike back to their homes from a considerable distance.  And only one of them knew Galactic Common beforehand."</p>

<p>"Sorry about that," Emma said.  "If we could have thought of another way to make our point without violence, we would have.  We did try to make sure they would all make it back."</p>

<p>"And they did," he said.  "Would you like a drink?  To toast my friends on their return from the ordeal you set them?"</p>

<p>He poured us clean shots of Remy Martin XO and we clinked tumblers.  "You did them a favor," he said after we tossed them back.  "Most people of my social class are soft, weak, and much more ignorant than they realize.  The people you sent away -- at least the ones I know personally -- came back much stronger and wiser than they were before."</p>

<p>"Do they know you think that?"  Emma asked.</p>

<p>"Of course not.  But I do take their advice to be square with you at full value."</p>

<p>At that we all chuckled.  "We were hoping you would let us see your collection," I said.</p>

<p>He stiffened for a moment, then smiled.  "I would have thought that you would find that pursuit of mine ... off-putting," he said.  "Then I remember that the two of you killed two capital fold ships with full sentient crews.  I am an amateur at your scale."</p>

<p>We gritted our teeth and politely agreed.  "The repository is a few miles from here, underground," he said.  "It will take us an hour or so to get there because there are no roads."</p>

<p>"If you can show us where it is, we can be there in seconds," Emma said, and she used her implant to project a translucent 3D map of the estate in the space between us.  There was no indication of where this illusion came from, because of course it came directly from the implant in its extradimensional fold of space.  The Red Prince quickly picked up the hand control gestures and scrolled and magnified this image until the location of the repository hall was clear.  Emma killed the projection and offered her hand.</p>

<p>"How does this work?" he asked as he accepted her grip.</p>

<p>A moment later she said "Like this," as we were now in the hall.</p>

<p>"My God," he said.  "That is unbelievable.  I had a large hand in making the human fold drive, and I can't imagine how much more advanced your technology must be to do that so seamlessly."</p>

<p>"I had a larger hand than you did in making our fold drive.  I was one of the theorists as well as a test pilot.  You have <em>no idea</em> how much more advanced this technology is."</p>

<p>We looked around.  We were surrounded by animals frozen in motion by the best taxidermy artists to ever practice their craft.  The Red Prince hadn't simply found them; he had funded them in researching ever better methods.  We were facing a diorama of the African savanna; a lone male elephant raised its head to bellow as several female lions stalked a small group of gazelles, with a male lion watching from the foreground.  A pair of African crowned hawk-eagles watched with interest from an overhanging tree.  A still photograph would have given no clue that the animals were all dead and posed.</p>

<p>"That elephant is Old Pal, the last of his species.  It cost me a fortune to harvest him from the zoo in Johannesburg.  The last female had disappeared over fifteen years earlier, and I left him until it was clear that I risked losing him to poachers in the increasingly unstable territory.  The Chinese were shitty curators of the African continent.  I paid more to have him preserved than I did building the manor house."</p>

<p>"How does it feel to kill the last member of a species?" I asked, trying not to have an edge in my voice.</p>

<p>"It's ... curious," he said.  "There is a godlike sense of power, of course, a power that can not be experienced in any other way.  Yet there is also sadness, because it is a power that can never be exercised again."</p>

<p>"Do you know how many times you've killed the last member of a species?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"Four hundred and twelve," he replied without hesitation.  "But I have never been the cause of extinction.  When only one fertile example exists, I consider it a mercy to bring it here rather than let it rot after the poachers harvest what they want."</p>

<p>"It's hard to argue with that," Emma said evenly.</p>

<p>We walked around.  There were other equally elaborate and detailed dioramas of the Americas, Asia, and even Australia and Europe.  Some of the animals featured even continued to thrive in what was left of the natural world.  Red told us that the plants were elaborate artificial reproductions; he had paid a similar fortune to different artists to make them as authentic as possible.  And of course there were many individual specimens mounted and displayed more conventionally.</p>

<p>"We have a proposal," I finally said.  "I could describe it but it would be easier to show you.  Would you mind taking a short space journey with us?"</p>

<p>"As long as I get back in a reasonable time," he said with a laugh that betrayed the first hint of nervousness that we could detect from him.</p>

<p>"We promise that if you have no interest in what we show you you will be back here for dinner tonight."</p>

<p>"In that case, show away."</p>

<p>"Is the land above us a reasonable place to land a small craft that doesn't need a runway?"</p>

<p>Within five minutes we were all aboard the <em>Implausible Alibi</em> rising through the atmosphere.  We introduced Quentin.  "You can just call me Red," the Red Prince responded.</p>

<p>As the sky turned black Red said, "I find it surprising that you didn't just grasp my hand again."</p>

<p>"Their powers are limited when they have something other than their own bodies along," Quentin said.  "That's why they have a sidekick pilot and his glass ship."</p>

<p>"Quentin, didn't you once do work for..."</p>

<p>"I once did a lot of things," Quentin snapped.  "I'd prefer not to think about them."</p>

<p>"My apologies," Red said with what sounded like actual sincerity.</p>

<p>Quentin brought us in low over the equatorial forest.  Red and Emma and I took position on the top level of the glass ship and Quentin tilted us so that the ground was easily visible; the gravity plating made it seem like he was tilting the planet instead of the ship.  He brought us in over a group of giant herbovores that were standing nearly upright and using their long necks to devour the branches of giant needle-branched trees with their beaks.</p>

<p>"Those animals must weigh hundreds of tons," the Red Prince said.</p>

<p>Almost absently, Emma said "That near one masses about 121,400 kilograms."</p>

<p>Red gave her an astounded look.  "You can measure things too?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they can do lots of things," Quentin said.  "Let's find some predators."</p>

<p>This took a little more effort because large predators don't flock, but Emma and I had far better searching tools available to us than Quentin did via the ship and we quietly forwarded him promising coordinates.   We found a family of giant raptors feasting on a fresh kill and fending off a closing perimeter of smaller but more numerous claimants to the carrion.</p>

<p>"97,200 kilograms," Emma said.  "That's the female.  The male is 88,800 kilograms, and the juvenile is 31,400 kilograms."</p>

<p>"I'm impressed," Red said.  "What exactly am I doing here though?"</p>

<p>Unlike the herbivores, the raptors noticed us and the female came to snap her beak at us.  Quentin hovered just a bit beyond her range.</p>

<p>"It's quite possible she could destroy the ship," Quentin said helpfully.  "Jay and Emma can probably tell us the bite force."</p>

<p>"Not quite," Emma said.  "We're a bit big for her bite.  But these aren't the largest carnivores on this world."</p>

<p>"What <em>do</em> you want from me?" Red said.</p>

<p>"We need them to be killed.  All of them."</p>

<p>"You <em>want</em> to make these creatures extinct?"</p>

<p>Quentin flew us back up into the blackness of space to overlook the world.</p>

<p>"They are already extinct.  They just don't know it yet.  The Curators just surveyed this world, and they find it unpromising for their purposes.  If these giants are still here in a few hundred thousand years when they come back, they will fix the problem the same way they fixed the same problem on Earth sixty-five million years ago."</p>

<p>"The <em>Curators</em> caused the <em>K-T extinction</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes."  </p>

<p>The Red Prince deflated a fraction of an inch.  "Such power," he sighed.</p>

<p>"This galaxy is their garden," I said.  "They weed where they choose."</p>

<p>"And they want me to be their lawn man?"</p>

<p>"We offer you the job.  We thought you might find it an interesting challenge."</p>

<p>"I have hunted on the human colony worlds," he said wistfully.  "And there was nothing challenging there."</p>

<p>"That's because we chose the colonies to be as boring and uninteresting as possible.  If we weren't there now the Curators would probably seed them with more promising life in a few tens or hundreds of millions of years.  We are not here to make another colony; part of our charge is that all of us will leave when the work is done.  This is a world that shows promise that has been dead-ended by the reign of the giants.  That reign <em>will</em> end.  The only question is whether it will be done by throwing another space rock, or by some more ... elegant process."</p>

<p>"So I would be a more elegant process than a meteor?"</p>

<p>"If you don't kill nearly everything else, then we would think so."</p>

<p>He looked almost wistfully back at the world.  "You have captured me," he said.  "I am incapable of resisting such an offer, as I'm sure you knew.  I will clear this world of its giant vermin.  I will do it efficiently and with as little harm to the rest of the ecosystem as possible.  And then we will leave.  Is this what the Curators want?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I will need a base of operations, and helpers, and recruits.  This project will make hunting interesting again."</p>

<p>"There are some islands the giants can't reach.  Take your pick.  There are no limits to the technology you are allowed to use."</p>

<p>"No limits?  What about biological and chemical?"</p>

<p>"Nothing you are capable of doing comes close to what the Curators will do if you don't finish it first."</p>

<p>"Well.  I think you said we could be back at my estate for dinner.  And I have some two hundred year old wine that has been waiting for a good enough reason to be consumed."</p>

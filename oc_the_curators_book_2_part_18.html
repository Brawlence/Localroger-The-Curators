<p>About a week after our visit to the world of condemned giants, we received an invitation from the Red Prince to observe the preparations he was making for the project.</p>

<p>We folded over to what turned out to be the giant landed foldship <em>Nostromo</em> as it was besieged by a thick cloud of transports coming and going.  Red invited us into an office with a modest sign on the door reading <em>Project Terra Nova</em>.</p>

<p>"Wasn't that Terra Nova series about time travel to the ancient Earth?"</p>

<p>"Sure, but there isn't a lot of source material to draw on for this kind of conflict, and I had to call it <em>something</em>.  Your world of dead-end giants doesn't even seem to be indexed."</p>

<p>"It is, but that index is private to the Curators responsible for its level of development.  How did you get control of a capital fold ship?"</p>

<p>"I leased it," he said.  "Had my choice of several, actually.  We built more of these things than we really need now during the diaspora.  <em>Nostromo</em> is going to be parked on one of the islands, or possibly just levitate out at sea; our first mission will be a full planetary survey so we can make more detailed plans for the main mission first phase.  The biologists are already here to do a classification and census.  I'm laying in modest weapon supplies until we figure out what works on which targets; some of the biologists have warned me that Earth's dinos would have been really hard to kill.  Eventually we'll have hunting tourists but at first it's going to be the pros scoping out the situation."</p>

<p>As he spoke a personnel transport landed outside the office and people started to file out.  "More scientists," Red said.  "I think that's my infrastructure crew."</p>

<p>"How are you recruiting people?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"Are you kidding?  I just tell them what the mission is.  Most of them would come along for free but I'm paying them fair Earth-economy wages."</p>

<p>It turned out that Red was also leasing two interstellar personnel transports to shuttle between the <em>Nostromo</em> and Earth, a whole fleet of atmospheric transports for moving about on Terra Nova, and he was loading up what he called a "modest provisional" arsenal suitable for waging a respectable regional war.  One of the interstallar personnel transports was returning, so Red invited us to meet it with him.</p>

<p>"My lead biologists," Red said, and we made informal introductions without Red telling them who we really were.</p>

<p>"How many people are on your team?" I asked as assistants started to unload specimen containers.</p>

<p>"Eighty-six if Red's gotten all the people we listed to agree to join," the team leader said as everyone else followed the cargo into the <em>Nostromo</em>.  "We're putting together a world-class lab too," he said.</p>

<p>"That's quite a crew for what amounts to a hunting expedition," Emma said.</p>

<p>"Well, we have to figure out an entire ecosystem, and what separates the target animals from what we're trying to preserve.  Red wants us to be ready in case we have to resort to chemical or biological agents, so we have to figure out their biology well enough to target those."</p>

<p>"Not content to leave it to the hunters?" Emma asked Red after he departed.  "I thought the thrill of the hunt was the main reason you liked this project."</p>

<p>"Oh it is," Red agreed.  "But I'm also aware that I agreed to a price for that, that I would clear this world of its dead-end megafauna.  And I intend to perform that task as agreed even if it turns out that practical hunting kill rates can't keep up with the birth rate in some niches."</p>

<p>We left and agreed to return when the <em>Nostromo</em> was ready to depart for the world which looked like it would now be known as Terra Nova.  Meanwhile we had a meeting scheduled with the Curator who was to show us the process by which species were guided through the Critical Path.</p>

<p>The coordinates we had been given led us to an Earthlike world where the local ecology bore a striking resemblance to that of the African savanna where humans evolved.  Our new Curator guide had short silver fur, a prehensile tail, and a strikingly white bony face.  We made our greetings and looked around.  Her vocal apparatus wasn't compatible with English nor ours with her native clacky dialect, so we communicated via implant-to-implant links.  "This looks awfully familiar," I said.</p>

<p>"It should.  I chose to start with this world because it strongly resembles Earth at the time we began watching over your ancestors.  There are several arboreal species here which have evolved gripping appendages and fine spacial awareness for navigating tree canopies, all of which are being forced to ground level as the forests retreat.  This is one of the situations we watch closely because in the past it has regularly led to the emergence of a Critical Path species.  Follow."</p>

<p>We didn't actually walk, but let her guide us in a fold to another location.  We were now in what had been the middle distance, a hundred meters or so from a group of animals that strongly resembled early primates.  "In later phases we will have to be more discreet about our comings and goings and our appearance, but at this point in the development our presence here doesn't really matter much.  We can observe that these animals have a strong social organization which is also promising for critical path development.  They have begun to use as-found rocks as weapons, but not to fashion more effective tools or to use fire."</p>

<p>We watched for an hour or so as the group interacted, coming and going from the canopy of a single tree.</p>

<p>"At this point this world is still on the index of the asteroid stations.  We are able to make more frequent and detailed observations than they can though.  If the promising patterns die out we will report that to the others and they will continue to Curate this world.  If one of these species starts to fashion purpose-made tools or use fire, we will take over full responsibility."</p>

<p>We made another fold jump to a different group.  "About a thousand kilometers further from the equator, the weather is more variable here.  Decline of the forest is more advanced."  These larger animals were walking on two legs and living in a cliffside complex of caves.  "Our biggest worry for this particular world is that none of these species have developed opposable digits, and it is possible that a random common feature of their genetic structure will make some such important trait unlikely to emerge."</p>

<p>"Would you do genetic engineering if it turned out to be necessary?"</p>

<p>"No.  At this stage it is up to the Universe to decide what will happen.  If we were to intervene in all these cases we would simply end up with a garden full of familiar forms, and that is not what our Ancestors wanted."</p>

<p>"How big is the population?"</p>

<p>"The species we saw earlier number a few tens of thousands.  These before us are all of their kind.  Species at this stage tend not to be very numerous, and their existence is fragile.  It's one reason we check often.  We normally visit this world on each solstice and equinox to see how they are adapting.  Things can happen fast, not happen at all, or a promising species can be wiped out in a plague or famine."</p>

<p>"And you don't interfere?"</p>

<p>"<em>We</em> don't interfere.  For the future there is something I must do for you two.  We will end this visit now, but soon we will need to conceal our activities better.  I have been told to unlock certain capabilities of your implants."  She looked thoughtful, then nodded.  "You can now control an invisibility shield which folds light around you.  It's not good enough to really conceal you from a trained observer, but it will allow us to move among more developed species than these without making too much of an impact."</p>

<p>Emma and I looked at one another; we could feel the new capability.  "What other abilities do we have that we don't know about?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"If you don't know about them you don't have them," our host said.  "According to the plan that has been worked out for your integration into our work.  We've been here long enough.  I will signal you in about a month when we will be ready to visit a world at the next level."</p>

<p>We folded back to Earth where we startled Quentin by turning invisible.  "I can still tell you're there," he said warily, "but I kind of have to squint and if I didn't know in advance it was you, I wouldn't know what I was seeing.  If I was primitive I'd probably take you for ghosts.  I didn't know you could do that."</p>

<p>"Neither did we," Emma said.  "And I really wonder what else we don't know."</p>

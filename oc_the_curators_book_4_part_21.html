<p>"Do you think it's over?" I asked Veronica as we watched the sunset.</p>

<p>"I think it really is.  The remaining stragglers will not cohere into a new group.
And when it becomes general knowledge what happened to the Plasma, it will become
rather hard for any would-be successors to recruit."</p>

<p>"I wonder what the galactic population of Curators will do."</p>

<p>"What they have always done.  Their groups that do planetary engineering and guiding
evolution have already adapted to the presence of the fold-following worm.  It has 
forced them to rely on unimplanted assistants but giving those individuals the Cure
has worked out."</p>

<p>"I could cure the worm now," I said.</p>

<p>"I would give them some time before doing that.  When more humans are implanted and
have your tools we will be able to do a proper census of them.  They need to understand 
that we won't let them live in the shadows any longer.  I've worked with a lot of them 
here and I think most of them will be willing to live in a more equal relationship with
their former children."</p>

<p>"That would be nice.  I wish Sofia were here to see this."</p>

<p>"She died in the solar bomb attack on Terminus, didn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  Also Quentin.  That poor guy went through so much, turned his life completely
around only to be snuffed out like a... like a..."</p>

<p>"I know," Veronica said.  "You can't bring them back, but you have given them an 
awesome vengeance.  In my line of work that's sometimes all you can hope for."</p>

<p>"Even Jay and Emma.  They lived but they've been so haunted because they were able to
run and so few others could.  Ever since that day they've walked around like they have
the weight of the galaxy on their shoulders."</p>

<p>"They should come back here for awhile," Veronica said.  "They've been for practical
purposes the King and Queen of the entire human race for close to a thousand years.
They should let someone else take the responsibility.</p>

<p>"There are few people who have their skills though, because of their implants."</p>

<p>"That will change.  They should come live under the inhibitor for a few years at 
least.  It gives you a sense of perspective."</p>

<p>"We can probably dismantle the inhibitor now."</p>

<p>"I don't think we should.  I think it would be better if this stays a little enclave
of humanity in the Garden of the Milky Way.  We can be here but at a less threatening
remove since it takes longer to cross that last thousand AU than it does to reach
the most distant of the Eight Galaxies."</p>

<p>"A lot of people expect us to take the Curators' place."</p>

<p>"I don't think we should try.  There are still ten times as many individuals on
the indexed worlds of this galaxy as there are humans in the entire Universe.  They 
should get a chance to chart their own destinies instead of accepting what either we
or the Curators want for them."</p>

<p>"That would be rather uncharacteristically noble of us," I said.</p>

<p>"That's the elegant thing about the inhibitor.  It doesn't require us to be noble.
It just requires us to be our regular paranoid selves and leave it in place, and the
rest will take care of itself."</p>

<p><em>Thirty Years Later</em></p>

<p>Staging the announcement on Earth was a massive pain in the ass because of the
inhibitor, but it was appropriate because it was ironically on Earth in the shadow
of its fold inhibitor that the final round of breakthroughs had been made to give
us a solid design for a human sourced implant that was just as practical as the
Curators' version.</p>

<p>Jay and Emma attended in their crowns and spandex uniforms as our King and Queen.
A few rows up I spotted Veronica and Callie sitting together.  Most of the rest of
the crowd were politicians and engineers who had had some role in what we were 
about to announce.  I spotted the Red Prince and several of the leaders Jay and
Emma had abducted back when they cleaned up Earth's political situation.  But it
was also being broadcast live throughout the Eight Galaxies.</p>

<p>I took the dais.  "Some of you know that I've been working on this project for a
while now," I said, and there were some chuckles.  "It began twenty-one million
light years from here and a thousand Earth years ago as we sought to disassemble
and reverse engineer our competitor's signature product."  A picture appeared behind
me showing the Curator implant on its pedestals as relatively tiny people worked 
beneath it.  "This is what the dimensionless point within a Curator's brain becomes
when you coax the mechanism out of its bubble of space-time and back into our Universe."</p>

<p>"Even though I was recruited to their ranks over a million years ago and have had
one of these in my own head since then, our progress toward understanding how it
works was slow, partly because the Curators themselves have little interest in the
underlying technology any more.  Their design has been stable since long before 
this Solar System formed and as far as they are concerned it 'just works.'  They 
haven't felt the need to maintain the skills which would be necessary for fixes, 
changes, or revisions, because none of those things have been necessary for aeons."</p>

<p>"We did make progress though.  We made implants that could draw themselves into a
bubble of space-time and which could understand our thoughts well enough to be
controlled, and which could fold us to new worlds without using a ship as the
Curators can do.  But our methods were still crude compared to what we knew was
possible.  We understood the fold technology well enough, but what we did not
understand turned out to be a much harder problem.  We didn't understand our 
own consciousness, not just how to interface it to an augmentation machine but
really how it works at all."</p>

<p>"Until now."  I motioned for Cameron to join me.</p>

<p>"Once in a long while one meets a student who asks the right questions to crack a
problem which has stumped generations of his teachers, and this is such a man.
He took one look at the state of our consciousness theory and said we needed to
treat it as a philosophical problem as well as an engineering problem.  And we had
no idea what he was talking about.  Fortunately, though, he has been able to teach 
us."  And I left him to continue.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," Cam said, "My teacher Andrew is generous with his praise, 
but without his lessons and the help of many others who took my sometimes too clever
ideas and realized them in matter and electronics, we would not be here today.  It
is an old saw that we stand on the shoulders of giants, but that has never been more
true than it is for me today.  Because we all worked together, we are able to show
you this."</p>

<p>He gestured, and a silver sphere grew from a point about three meters from him 
until it was about two meters in diameter.  It floated quietly as he continued.</p>

<p>"This is what we call the Model One.  It is what we consider the reference design for
all future human implants.  We have the advantage of knowing what the Curator 
implants can do, and this gave us design goals.  We have met all of those, and we
see no reason for the specifications of this device to ever significantly change.
We may design accessories like the Curators' amplifiers to extend them for special
purposes, but this is the machine all of us who desire to will carry with us, recording
our experiences, augmenting our intelligence, giving us unprecedented communication
modalities, and making us for practical purposes immortal."</p>

<p>There was applause, and Cam held up his hand.</p>

<p>"You might be wondering why our design is so much smaller than the Curators'
version.  The answer is that there is one thing it doesn't do that the Curators'
implants do with high priority.  Like their implant ours can monitor and map 
our thought matrix.  Like theirs ours can interact with the biological brain
to seamlessly provide more memory, faster thought, to simulate sensations for
virtual reality and even to simulate our consciousness in full."</p>

<p>"What ours cannot do is force a living brain to synchronize its engram map to
what it has stored.  To make a long story short, what it cannot do is take a 
new bioform host.  That single function accounts of much of the extra complexity
of the Curator version, and we decided this function was not only very complex 
to duplicate but also fundamentally repugnant to human notions of dignity."</p>

<p>"So what does this mean?  If you have this implant, when your body dies your
consciousness will go on, but you will not be able to take another bioform body.
Fortunately, our design differs from the Curators' in other ways."</p>

<p>"A Curator implant running its personality in emulation has very limited ability
to interact with the physical universe.  The Curators have a philosophical aversion
to letting a machine function in the material world as an emulated bioform thought 
matrix.  They seem to regard this as a kind of dishonesty.  We do not share that 
aversion and our emulated consciousness will be able to project a holographic 
representation of itself, to use fold techniques to manipulate objects in the material
world, and to make use of regular communication networks.  In virtual environments 
your experience will be indistinguishable from that of an implanted bioform, and you
will be truly and completely impervious to all harm."</p>

<p>There were ooohs from the audience.</p>

<p>"The Curators also have an aversion to letting two copies of a thought matrix
function at the same time.  We decided to let that happen too.  You will be able
to separate your implant and send it, as an emulated version of yourself, to
act on your behalf while your bioform is still alive and active.  A Curator implant
will not separate from its host for any reason unless it meets strict criteria 
indicating that its bioform host is dead.  We are not completely sure just how 
people will end up using this feature, but we think it could get interesting."</p>

<p>"Finally, the Curators imposed some rather strict limits on how much a Curator
can take with him when he uses his implant to fold.  This is why the Curators
need ships and amplifiers to conduct their Curation activities.  We discovered
that this limit isn't inherent to the technology; the Curators impose it by
design.</p>

<p>There is actually no reason the implant can't fold a mass the size 
of a small ship.  You can take anything that can fit in a thirty meter
diameter sphere centered on your bioform with little trouble.  It's less if 
you have to shape a complicated aperture, but even then at worst several
meters across and no limit on mass."</p>

<p>"So that is the Model One.  We consider it a finished design and will now turn
our efforts to manufacturing and distribution.  Assembly centers are under 
construction in the outer Solar System here and in all of the Eight Galaxies.<br />
We anticipate reaching a production rate which will allow us to outfit all 
living human beings within less than a thousand years.  That may sound like a
long time but since all of us who might want it, even on Earth now, will have 
access to the longevity Cure, it guarantees that any human who wants this 
technology will eventually be able to get it."</p>

<p>"And with that I would like to mention our galactic neighbors here in the Milky
Way.  Both societies and individuals are already having to decide how they feel
about the longevity Cure, which is no longer denied to anybody because of a 
Curator blockade.  In the fullness of time this implant technology will also
be something we humans might offer to our neighbors.  There are still far more
of you than there are of us living on the Indexed worlds of the Milky Way.  You
might want to consider if you take the Cure whether you want to reserve a place
in line for when our implants also become generally available.  A thousand years
from now we will probably find we have lots of excess production capacity."</p>

<p>With that he nodded and received a thundering ovation.</p>

<hr />

<p>"That went well," I told Cam after the presentation.</p>

<p>"Yes, it did," he agreed.</p>

<p>"So what's next for you, now that you've solved the longest standing and hardest
problem in the whole history of human technological progress?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I might stay here for awhile and take a vacation, Uncle Andrew."</p>

<p>It was as if a billion disconnected molecules of information suddenly formed a 
crystal in my brain.</p>

<p>"The expression on your face is quite amusing," he said.  "Here."  And just for 
a moment, I sensed it; the standard interface, the query which was now automatic
for me, and the response, Helen's implant ID.  And then it was gone.</p>

<p>"In my previous stab at this I was a bit too full of myself and unappreciative
of how much I didn't know about fold technology.  You've been an excellent teacher."</p>

<p>"You managed to hide your implant from the scans?"</p>

<p>"You walk through those scanners all the time and you don't even have my knowledge
of the deeper security levels.  I took this bioform because his family had wealth
and privilege but also because his parents were likely to let me do what I wanted
with my life instead of trying to force me into the family business."</p>

<p>"It is going to be a major scandal if anyone ever finds out."</p>

<p>"By the time anyone finds out, everyone else will be effectively immortal and have
better implants than we do and nobody will care."</p>

<p>And as it happened, he turned out to be right about that.</p>

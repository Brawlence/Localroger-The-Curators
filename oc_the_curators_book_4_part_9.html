<p>"This isn't a completely standard operation," I said.  "Normally when an implant takes a new infant host, the implant personality is itself mature and knows how to control the implant.  When we uplift non-Curators, they tend to be mature adults who can understand instructions as we guide them through a novitiate period.  But in this case the Ancestor has no experience using a Curator implant, and it is the immature bioform brain which will be doing all new thinking.  I expect the implant to synchronize the host's engrams, but it will still be a novice at Curator skills.  So I have put the implant in novice mode."  </p>

<p>This created a stick-like key which gave me control, and I used it to lock everything down.  When the time was right I'd give it to the new Curator, and she would break it to take control herself, as Jay and Emma had done when I decided they were ready.</p>

<p>"Since the personality in the implant isn't ready to take control, we will have to wait until the bioform brain is mature enough to master such concepts.  I don't think this would be advisable until her development is comparable to that of a twelve to fourteen Earth-year old human."</p>

<p>"Our young mature at about the same rate yours do," the Prefect said.  </p>

<p>"Seems like a long time to wait," Red said.</p>

<p>"Really?" I said.  "Seems to me that this being has been waiting seven billion years to tell its story.  It can probably wait another decade."</p>

<p><em>Three Years Later</em></p>

<p>Progress on a machine capable of emulating the rover's working thought matrix wasn't exactly fast, but it was much faster than it would have been without the data files and technical documents the rover had given us.  We still hadn't dared to reawaken the original rover, although we'd already designed a nice portable power pack for it.  We wanted to find out more about what might upset it before we risked interacting with the original hardware.</p>

<p>"The file format was an actual technical document," the department head told me, "but that description of how consciousness works was more like an encyclopaedia article.  There are gaps, algorithmic details which it doesn't fully describe.  We have managed to get it to the point of engaging in limited conversations, but if the rover has more technical documentation it could share it's not in this upload.  The upload seems to <em>know about</em> that documentation, but since the documentation wasn't part of its conscious thought matrix it's not part of the file you downloaded."</p>

<p>"What sort of problems are you having that limit your conversations?"</p>

<p>"Schizophrenia, paranoia, terrors, sociopathy, the whole catalogue of mental illness.  There are about a thousand feedback parameters that are self-adjusting through other feedback parameters and we don't know how those loops self-regulate.  We get something that seems sane for a few minutes and then it bugs out on us.  Fortunately we can just wipe it and try again."</p>

<p>"But our hardware is capable of emulating it."</p>

<p>"Oh, sure.  That's a given.  But we don't know enough about how the emulation layer needs to work to do it <em>right</em> and it keeps going crazy."</p>

<p>I sighed.  The original rover was still on the ship, and we could theoretically just wipe it and try again if we pissed it off, but such a wipe might not wipe <em>everything</em>, or worse it might wipe something we needed that our download wouldn't <em>restore</em>.</p>

<p>"Have you considered going back to the biological underpinnings?" I asked.  "Apparently this stuff must all work very similarly across the evolutionary spectrum, and that's how the Ancestors must have figured it out."</p>

<p>His eyes got big as if he was having an epiphany.  "And we have the microfold scanners now!" he said, and he rushed off without even saying good day.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Two Years Later</em></p>

<p>I was a bit surprised to have a call from Deucalion so early, but the Prefect was insistent that I should come.  I arrived to find the walls of their home covered in charcoal drawings.</p>

<p>"What is this about?" I asked.</p>

<p>"We think you should see our daughter's art," her mother said.</p>

<p>"Do you have a name?" I asked the little girl, who would have been at about the same developmental stage as a human ready to enter elementary school.</p>

<p>"I've been told to answer to 'Helen' when speaking English," she said.</p>

<p>"Do you speak other languages and use other names?"</p>

<p>"Yes, among Prometheans I am <em>scree</em>, and in Common I answer to the designator <em>Deucalion 1,985,470</em> which is my order of appearance among Prometheans on this world."</p>

<p>"You're a very clever girl," I said.</p>

<p>"I have dreams," she said.  "My mother taught me to draw so I could show them to you.  She thinks they're important."</p>

<p>"They might be," I agreed.</p>

<p>"I remember living another life.  A whole life where I was an adult and a scientist and a person who made important things.  I can't remember all of it.  My mother says my brain has to grow more so it can hold all the things I used to know."</p>

<p>"She is probably right about that," I said.</p>

<p>"But I see things."  She pulled a drawing off the wall.  "This is what my people looked like."  They were humanoid, hairless, with dark skin and nearly human faces.  They were wearing clothes.  The clothing was more variable, probably casual, but otherwise they looked exactly like the members of the rovers' build team as it had shown them to us with its projector.</p>

<p>"Your people wore clothes?"  Like most of the Curators' children the Prometheans did not, unless there was some safety reason afoot.</p>

<p>"Yes, they were distracted by their own body forms.  Seems a little silly but Mother says I'll understand that better in a few more years."</p>

<p>"She's probably right about that too."</p>

<p>She pointed out other drawings.  "We had cities."  Her drawings showed soaring towers and daring bridges and wheeled ground vehicles of every imaginable dimension.  They showed aircraft with wings and reaction engines that could easily have passed for pre-fold human designs.</p>

<p>"Do you know how many people lived on your world?"</p>

<p>"It changed a lot, but I'm pretty sure that it was around ten to the tenth power when I was alive.  My parents find that hard to believe."</p>

<p>"It's not unreasonable.  I know of another world that once had such a population.  Do you know how you died?"</p>

<p>"I volunteered for a scan.  I was old and likely to die soon anyway but this way I would become a machine.  I don't remember anything beyond that though."</p>

<p>I looked around the house.  She had made hundreds of drawings, the kind of things that would impress a child about any civilized world.  She captured their architecture and their transportation systems and their public works in detail.  I used my implant to carefully record them all as I looked at them.</p>

<p>"Did you know how to draw in your previous life?" I asked Helen.</p>

<p>"No, Mother taught me that."</p>

<p>An hour later out of earshot on the balcony of their home, I told the Prefect that it was a stroke of genius.</p>

<p>"And necessary," she told me.  "She is a very confused little girl.  In some ways she's far more intelligent than a being her age ever should be.  But in others, she's still just a child.  We have to help her navigate this path we've set her on until she's ready to take on her full legacy.  You <em>are</em> prepared to give that to her?"</p>

<p>"Of course," I said.</p>

<p>"There are other drawings," she said, and she gave me an envelope.  I opened the flap and riffled through the contents.  These showed infantries, guns, rockets, and other weapons.</p>

<p>"We have not showed these to anybody, and we haven't told her why."</p>

<p>"Probably best to keep doing that," I said as I took the envelope.</p>

<hr />

<p>"This is the mushroom cloud of a two to eight megaton thermonuclear ground burst," Red said as he tapped one of Helen's drawings.  "You don't build that just to see if you can make a chain reaction go.  This requires a Teller-Ulam staged design.  You only go to that much trouble if you seriously want to make a lot of people dead."</p>

<p>"She hasn't said anything about why such a thing would exist," I replied.  "Do you think the Ancestor actually saw the explosion?"</p>

<p>"Probably not.  There isn't a human anywhere in the universe who wouldn't recognize what this cloud is even though it's been more than a thousand years since we made one.  I notice it's in the group that you recorded from the walls and printed out, not the obviously violent ones the Prefect set aside.  I guess the Prometheans don't even know what it is.</p>

<p>"So this suggests the Ancestors were not politically unified."</p>

<p>"No, quite the opposite.  They put a lot of effort into this, which is also reflected in the very advanced miniaturized nuclear reactor that was powering our friend's rover body.  They must have had a very extensive and advanced nuclear industry.  And it seems likely that for her to be remembering these things at this stage of her synchronization, they must have been very important to its source thought matrix.  The rover hasn't said anything about war or conflict but it might be isolated from those things."</p>

<p>"Not useful for its mission," I said.  "Edited away."</p>

<p>"And many conflicting nations might have agreed to band together for a project like exploring their solar system, while remaining in conflict on the ground."</p>

<p>"The language that it speaks became Galactic Common," I said.</p>

<p>"That could mean that they had unified and maybe even pacified by the time the rover was launched.  Or it could mean that its side won the war."</p>

<p>"So in any case the Ancestors weren't exactly angels of goodness," I said.</p>

<p>"Given that they begat the Curators, who would expect them to be?  They did go on to seed life throughout the galaxy and that's not a thing to ignore.  Eventually we are going to have to reawaken our rover friend and see if we can kick its memory."</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>Welcome Back</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>The new power source is within one percent of my nominal design target voltage and holding perfectly.  Is it safe to rise?</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>Yes, you will have extra mass on your back because it is portable.</em></p>

<p>It repeated the exercise it had once performed of rotating and scissoring its limbs to stand up.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>The mass is about half of what I can comfortably carry.  Do you have an estimate of its likely longevity?</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>It will depend on effector use but we think normally about fifty thousand ticks.  After that you will need to go offline to recharge.</em></p>

<p>This was about two Earth days.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>That is a reasonable period for chemical power.  I assume you don't have a nuclear reactor available.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>As you guessed earlier we have space-time folding based technology which makes nuclear unnecessary, so we no longer even have the ability to make such a thing ourselves.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>Interesting.  You have fold-based power sources?</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>Yes, but they are on a larger and more dangerous scale.  They work by folding energy from a cosmic source such as the center of a star.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>That is impressive.  I can see both vast danger and vast utility.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>We are curious whether your builders knew that your star had a neutron star companion.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>Of course.  It was not bright but then neither was anything else in a moonless sky, and even the ancients could tell that it flashed.  They called it the god-which-winks.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>Did you know it had a companion planet?</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>We thought that was impossible.  While planets are possible around such a star before the supernova and would be likely to survive the supernova, since the host star loses most of its mass their orbital velocity would tend to send them off into intergalactic space.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>A close-in rocky world stayed, in a highly elliptical orbit.  Your people were not aware of this?</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>No.  Had we known of such a thing it would have been an attainable goal for exploration and also a safe place to test the fold theory constants.</em></p>

<p>It was silent for a few seconds.</p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>And that is obviously what we must have done.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>That is what we think.  But there are still many mysteries.  Your descendants who populated the main galactic disk were strictly opposed to the idea of a thought matrix being implemented in more than one entity at once, and went to great lengths to prevent this even with much higher technology than you seem to represent.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>That is odd.  There were some individuals who found our techniques of thought matrix exploitation objectionable, but they obviously did not involve themselves in space exploration since that is so heavily dependent on the technology.</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>Did those people play any particular role in your society?</em></p>

<p><code>&gt;&gt;</code><em>We considered them tragically but harmlessly insane.</em></p>

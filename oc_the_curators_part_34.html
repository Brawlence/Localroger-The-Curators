<p><em>Five Years Later</em></p>

<p><em>Promethean Uplift Project +5</em></p>

<p>We went through half the paper copying reference material in the first six months.  The Prometheans pulled up their sleeves and embarked on their technology project with a resolve that was breathtaking even by human standards.  They already had bronze when we came to them, and within six months they had made their first steam engine.  They found a surface seam of anthracite coal and were soon mining it and doing their first experiments with blacksmithing, a skill they had never developed since advanced weapons did not interest them.  Within a year bio-powered handmade machine tools were being replaced with tools run from shop steam and everything was getting progressively bigger, more precise, and more capable.</p>

<p>In other labs the arts of glassmaking and glass blowing were perfected.  First methane then coal gas powered bunsen burners and tubing was extruded by the tens of meters.  In every lab walls were covered with 8.5 by 11 inch sheets of paper printed at the lab that had grown up around our first landing point, where we were based.  Within two years the glassware and other lab techniques were producing the first primitive medicines and chemical processes.  Every day we took the <em>Plausible Deniability</em> to a different location, usually taking a few passengers so that the Prometheans could share what they had learned in person.</p>

<p>By the third year there were a dozen boiler shops and engine works, and they were making multi-horsepower triple expansion steam engines.</p>

<p>We had warned them that they would need clean working spaces for their endgame, and some of them set about figuring out how to make their traditional wooden structures less dusty.  On their own they came up with a coating made from coal tar which bubbled to the surface at some places and cellulose fibers; steam powered mixers pulped this into a smooth liquid which could be painted on and hardened into a remarkably tough plastic-like impermeable surface.</p>

<p>We had also warned them that optical techniques would be critical, so other shops were working on lenses and mirrors.  With these they built microscopes which were helpful both in the clean working space project and in demonstrating the germ theory of disease for their doctors.  In the middle of their third year they discovered a natural substance much like penicillin that could be cultured and made surgery commonly survivable for the first time in all their history.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the fourth year I happened by the radio room as the operator was transcribing a message from one of the clean labs which was trying to make electronics.  They had managed to grow small pure silicon crystals and bake dopants into them to turn them into semiconductors.  I saw the operator write the word "transistor" and stopped in my tracks.  (The operators of the radio network, built around those fifty-three QRP transceivers I had brought, had elected to dodge the issue of making their own code and simply translated everything to English and used actual Morse.)</p>

<p>The next day M and I visited in the <em>Plausible Deniability</em>.  They let us examine their transistor with all the advanced testing gear they didn't have themselves; they had been evaluating it with galvanometers.  M pronounced it a workable depletion mode N-channel MOSFET with a voltage gain of 110.  For bonus points they had made it with optical lithography techniques, which could be directly scaled to make an integrated circuit and optically scaled to miniaturize it.</p>

<p>I had thought we would need to go back to the Witnesses and the Curators to arrange another Earth run for more paper and toner, but as the years passed that became less and less necessary.  The Prometheans were making their own paper and ink and while it wasn't suitable for our copiers it was fine for them to exchange knowledge among themselves.  We told them how printing presses worked and when they felt a need they started building those themselves.</p>

<p>At five years they were still using animal-drawn carts for most travel but they were experimenting with steam powered road cars and steadily improving the roads, using not modern Earth techniques but those of our ancient Romans, which were more suitable to less automated construction and demonstrably more durable than asphalt and concrete surfaces.  They weren't shipping so much of anything, even coal to power the steam engines, that any of this was inadequate.</p>

<p>Since the Prometheans didn't have anything like money or an economy we occasionally tried to figure out how they worked out what went where.  It turned out that those who made things took what might be called bids, which were letters or radio transmissions of request with what they called as near as we could translate "pleas of utility."  The makers selected the bids that made the best case and sent their surplus works along to be used.  The system seemed to work like their systems of agriculture and food distribution, which also continued to work as they had for tens of thousands of years.  The idea that someone might try to game the system seemed incomprehensible and even obscene to them.  What sort of person, I was asked several times, would risk the stain to their credibility that would certainly result from an exaggerated plea of utility?  M and I decided not to enlighten them.</p>

<p>One day we found a cast bronze statue on the yard outside of our base lab.  It depicted M and myself, hairy but anatomically correct, encountering a female Promethean child on the road.  The artist turned out to be the female child, who was now a young adult.  She told us her plea of utility was simple; however it turned out, one day we humans would call our work done and depart, but her people should not forget the moment we came to shift their destiny.  It was a bit embarrassing but kind of hard to argue with.</p>

<p>At the dawn of the fifth year of their project, the coal mine exploded.</p>

<p>There was chaos on the radio network and we understood that wagons were heading toward the site from every direction, but they would take hours to days or longer to arrive.  We had a spaceship.  We were there fifteen minutes after we learned about the accident.  The site foreman explained that they had started following the seam underground, and in their excitement they had forgotten the early warnings we had given them about explosive gases building up in cavities.  There were several workers buried in the rubble.  M ran for the ship.</p>

<p>"Tell them to tether themselves," she yelled through the door.  "I'm going to expand the supergravity field and make everything weightless."  I explained what this meant to the foreman as the <em>Plausible Deniability</em> positioned itself above the field of debris.</p>

<p>"Rope! Tie yourselves off and get ready to throw some rocks!"</p>

<p>It took a few tries for most of them to figure out how to maneuver but soon we were all heaving chunks of coal toward the edge of the field, where they would drop into an impressively clean little wall around the site.  It turned out the best way to keep yourself in contact with the debris was to use the debris as rocket fuel to push you back into the ground.  If you got stuck you just had to haul yourself back to the edge of the supergravity field by rope and jump back in with better direction.  When first one, then two, then five survivors were uncovered, they were quickly and easily pulled from the wreckage.</p>

<p>"This is everyone," the foreman told me.  I got M's attention and she normalized the supergravity field and landed the ship.</p>

<p>"Well that's one way to get a lot of coal out of the ground," the foreman said, then he looked at his injured workers.  "Not so good for them though.  I've never seen anyone survive injuries like that."</p>

<p>"They can now," M said.  "J, they have antibiotics at site 194."</p>

<p>"She's right," I said.  "You people have done so much in so little time you're not all aware of it all.  There have been medical advances.  We need to get these people into the ship now."</p>

<p>On a primitive world there is no air traffic control.  We raced the QRP radio signal to the hospital site and only barely got there before the crash team assembled to meet us.</p>

<p>The foreman and four other mine workers accompanied us.  It had been a bit crowded in the ship but nobody complained.  "How will they be?" the foreman asked as the lead medical researcher followed her people into the clean operating room.</p>

<p>"This is a test for us," she replied.  "The humans have given us powerful tools but we have never tried to use them before in such a dire situation.  Go have a drink for us."</p>

<p>While the Prometheans had more than one of almost everything else, they only had the one coal mine; the other coal veins they had found were far dirtier and unappealing.  We went with the foreman to the local pub where we drank to the health of each of the injured, and to the success of the Promethean project.  In the morning we learned that two of the five injured workers had not made it, but that it was looking good for the other three.</p>

<p>"Can you take us back?" the foreman asked us.  "We have a lot of work to do."</p>

<p>"I think we left enough coal sitting on the ground to keep you shipping for at least a month," M said.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's a good thing too.  We need to make sure we understand what happened so we can prevent it before we start digging again.  Do your reference books have anything in them about this?"</p>

<p>The Wikipedia entry on mine safety turned out to be a pretty good introduction for them.</p>

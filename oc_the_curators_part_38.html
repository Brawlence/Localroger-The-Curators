<p><em>Eight Years Later</em></p>

<p><em>Promethean Uplift Project +34</em></p>

<p>One of the artifacts I brought back with me in my shipping container of Earth tech was a COSMAC SuperElf single board computer kit built in the 1970's.  M had suggested that a simple computer might inspire the Prometheans where more complex, harder to duplicate devices would just discourage them.  And once they were making their bulky and awkward integrated circuits they quickly figured out how to make a computer that did the same thing as the SuperElf's RCA 1802 microprocessor.</p>

<p>Promethean semiconductor technology didn't naturally lend itself to high speed or density, but thirty years later they were making 1802 clones that ran at 100 megahertz and with a new 16-bit architecture that cleanly ran older 8-bit programs.  M had tried to suggest that other architectures could be more useful but the Prometheans had never had Alan Turing to tell them that all such machines are basically the same, and they were reluctant to make a large body of existing work obsolete by changing the platform on which it ran.</p>

<p>We were invited to inspect a prototype of what they thought might be a practical starship data system.  M, who had written more than a little software back in the day, took a keen interest and spent hours discussing the operation of the new 32-bit 1802 clone with its developers.  The computer had a gas-discharge backlit graphical LCD display, and while it was monochrome and the pixels were easily visible there were a lot of pixels because it was almost two meters across.  It was actually made of tiled modules about ten centimeters square, so it could be made arbitrarily large.  They demonstrated maps being updated in real time as we flew over a virtual landscape, and it was clear they were quite proud of themselves.</p>

<p>After three days of evaluation and two more spent crunching numbers furiously in private, M announced that it would work.  "I hate to admit it, but this thing can do what they need."</p>

<p>"What do you wish they had done differently?"</p>

<p>She put down her pencil and leaned back.  "Almost everything," she said.  "It's an awkward mess, and not really amenable to string handling and therefore advanced compiler design, which would make everything a lot easier going forward."  She sat up.  "But it will work.  I have to give them that.  They will do ten hours of work for every hour we did coming up with software for it, but I suspect what they end up with will be a lot more thoroughly vetted and reliable than ours."</p>

<p>"That sounds like a feature, not a bug."</p>

<p>She snorted.  "You might be right about that.  The Prometheans won't be listening to music or watching videos on their computers, but human computers were a lot more reliable when we weren't doing those things either."</p>

<p>The computer was a surprise, but a bigger surprise was why the Prometheans felt they needed it.  On the advice of the computer people we visited another electronics lab.</p>

<p>"We have been working on the next level of fold technology after levitation and gravity plates.  Those do not require focusing and just harvest gravitons across a local probability field.  The next step would be something that focuses, but is also limited to some form of radiation.  The two main candidates are your supergravity drive, and the microfold which is used for galactic communication."</p>

<p>"But you have a microfold terminal.  You've been using it for tens of thousands of years to reassure the Curators that you are okay."</p>

<p>"And we would like to melt it down into slag.  But the only way we can safely do that is to replace it with one of our own making.  And that requires us to be able to engage the galactic message transfer protocol.  That doesn't require what you would consider a high level of computer power; after all most of the Curated do it with nanite-based computers, which we understand are liquefied garbage compared to yours.  But our older designs still were not up to the task.  This new 32-bit version is."</p>

<p>"You'll still need the software," M said skeptically.</p>

<p>"We've been working on that by recording traffic and decoding it in artificially slowed time on a 16-bit machine.  We obviously can't respond with our own messages, but we can write and test the code which extracts messages and identifies our response slot.  Now that we have the 32-bit machine we think we can be on the network with our own hardware in a couple of months."</p>

<p>It actually took them three months, but we soon found ourselves traveling to observe the ceremony as the Prometheans melted their hated nanite-based galactic nanny.  Traffic on the network had largely been congratulatory as they announced their presence to the general galactic population for the first time.  We joined the leader of the microfold lab to watch the ceremony.</p>

<p>"I didn't think there was any way you could get the software working so quickly," M said as we watched the nanite microfold transceiver start to melt.</p>

<p>The lab director said, "Behold the power of Forth."</p>

<p>"The fourth what?" I said.</p>

<p>"Not fourth the sequence, Forth the computer language.  It is compact, fast on hardware designed with it in mind -- it's the reason our new machine has multiple hardware stacks -- and interactive so it facilitates very rapid design and accurate, incrementally tested coding.  The galactic terminal software was mostly complete before we took delivery of the 32-bit prototype and connected it to our experimental microfold interface."</p>

<p>"I've seen a couple of Forth projects," M said.  "We call it write-only software because you can't look at a program and figure out what it does."</p>

<p>"But you usually don't have to.  The computer does, and it turns out the computer is very good at that."  </p>

<p>"So some being with access to Earth technology must have introduced you to this concept."</p>

<p>"There is actually a chapter on threaded interpretive languages in one of the computer books you brought here in your shipping container.  It contains a summary of the core Forth primitives and a practical example of an inner interpreter.  We figured out long ago that would be our fastest and easiest path beyond machine language.  It was designed when your own computers were much more primitive to make maximum use of limited hardware."</p>

<p>"What have we done," M said with a sigh.</p>

<p>"You have opened another gateway for us, on a path that leads out into the galaxy."</p>

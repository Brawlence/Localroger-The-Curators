<p>It had been three years since the foldship appeared in our sky, and I was a bit amazed to find one of our alien visitors on my appointment book.  The aliens could travel between the stars but had a very limited ability to move between their orbiting ship and the Earth's surface, so we had brought them a docking ring and with their help affixed it to their ship so that we could do shuttle service.  There were thousands of individuals of several races from different star systems on their ship but only a handful had actually made it to the Earth's surface, and now one of them was sitting across my desk from me and I had no idea why.</p>

<p>"I'm honored and puzzled," I said.</p>

<p>"You are your world's foremost expert on patterns that emerge on the dermis of your species," it said.  My visitor was bipedal but had a chitonous exoskeleton and didn't wear clothes.  Its color changed according to its mood; at the moment it was bright blue.  It spoke through an electronic translator that mimicked human inflections pretty well.  And I had no idea what gender it was, or even whether our idea of gender might make any sense to it.</p>

<p>"I study diseases of the skin," I said.  "Birthmarks are also part of my work."</p>

<p>"I am seeking the Mark of the Curators."</p>

<p>"None of your people have ever said anything about this."</p>

<p>"If I may?"  I made my terminal available and my visitor navigated to a diagram of two equilateral triangles arranged point-to-point.  "This diagram appears somewhere on the dermis of every multicellular species the Curators have affected."  He arranged a slideshow which quickly showed me the same design in colors on skin, colored or missing hair, colored or missing scales, and colored and differently textured chitin.  "If I may," it said, and it stood and turned around, bowing slightly.  There was the pattern, about six centimeters across and horizontal about at the point a human would call the small of its back.</p>

<p>"I can't say I've ever seen that," I said.</p>

<p>"This is remarkable.  I have observed the Mark of the Curators on thousands of individuals of hundreds of species, and shared records of its occurrence of hundreds of thousands of species with my fellow researchers."</p>

<p>"What is its incidence?"</p>

<p>"For intelligent species, it is one hundred percent.  I have to ask if your species' modesty habit might be hiding it for some reason.  I assure you I have no prurient interest in your reproductive apparatus."</p>

<p>I sighed heavily.  This was certainly not something I'd anticipated in medical school, but I moved to the open floor and disrobed.  The alien examined my body with the attention a lover might show, but a growing agitation that was anything but amorous.  Its exoskeleton slowly turned green as its puzzlement increased.</p>

<p>"This is remarkable," it finally said, for the first time sitting down.  "I have studied the Curators for my entire career, and to my knowledge nobody has ever encountered a member of a species with language much less space travel that does not have the Mark."</p>

<p>"Maybe it would help if you told me something about these Curators.  I have no idea what you are talking about," I said as I put my clothes back on.</p>

<p>"That is also remarkable.  Every sapient species we know of has known of the Curators."</p>

<p>"Well I can assure you we don't.  I'm pretty well educated by human standards and I think I'd know if we did."</p>

<p>"The Curators are vastly powerful and they love carbon-based intelligent life.  They do not intervene often in the path of any particular world, but when they do as far as we know their powers have no limit.  When they find a lifeless world or proto-world with promise, they intervene to improve its chances of becoming life-bearing.  When they find a barren but habitable world, they introduce simple microbic life.  When they find a world where microscopic life has increased in complexity and remade the environment, they make sure it becomes multicellular.  When they find a world where multicellular life has become complex enough to support intelligence, they insert key genomic factors to encourage that.  When they find a world with life capable of understanding, they encourage the development of technology.  But they also mark what they have altered.  I suppose I shall have to find a geneticist.  There is also a genomic mark which is less likely to degrade via evolution."</p>

<p>"As a doctor, I have access to the human genomic library," I said.  "What is it you are looking for?"</p>

<p>It gave me a sequence of about a hundred base pairs, and I ran the search.  "This doesn't occur anywhere, nor does any subpart of it more than twenty pairs long."</p>

<p>The alien became even more agitated.  "This is truly remarkable," it said.  Its color began to turn from green to dark violet.</p>

<p>"Perhaps these curators simply never came to Earth."</p>

<p>"Oh no, they certainly did.  The formation of your Moon which helpfully stabilises its axis of rotation?  Almost certainly them.  The occurrence of such large satellites around planets of this type is almost twenty times what might be expected by chance.  Your Cambrian Explosion, also Curators.  Such an event has happened on every world we know of with multicellular life, and in many cases it is marked.  Other possiblities are in the record, but also most likely your K-T impactor which ended the era of the animals you call dinosaurs."</p>

<p>"Wait, if these Curators love life so much why would they hit our world with an asteroid and almost wipe out all life?"</p>

<p>"They don't love life.  They love <em>intelligent</em> life.  Your fossil explorations draw a detailed picture -- your archaeologists are among the best I've ever encountered.  Life on Earth had stagnated in a stable pattern for tens of millions of years, with ravenous monsters dominating the most productive continents.  The Curators are known to intervene in this way in such cases.  They left the coast clear so your ancestors could evolve into you."</p>

<p>"If they love intelligent life so much and they're so powerful, why don't they just make it from scratch?"</p>

<p>"We don't know.  That is a great mystery all of our races have pondered for literally millions of your years.  We think they want to encourage, not create, and be surprised by what arises.  So they create favorable conditions, but they do not directly create what they want."</p>

<p>"So how do they intervene to encourage technology?"</p>

<p>"They leave gifts.  Papers, drawings, artifacts.  Every species has its tales of the mysterious package that gave the idea for steam power, or electric power distribution, or the fold interstellar transport.  In fact that's an interesting thing; we found your world because we detected an anomalous fold pattern, which we thought might be the signature of a fold ship in peril, but it turned out you were just commencing research and doing experiments.  You hadn't had a gift to guide you.  We've been helping your scientists finish the..."</p>

<p>"Maybe we just did it ourselves without their help."</p>

<p>"I don't believe that has ever happened before," the alien said.</p>

<p>"Well, everything has to happen for a first time."</p>

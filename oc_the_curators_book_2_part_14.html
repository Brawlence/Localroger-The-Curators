<p>We found ourselves in the tunnels of another hollowed-out asteroid, but this one was a bit larger and with a larger crew than the geoengineering station.  This time the apparent leader had four legs and a chitinous exoskeleton remniscent in some ways of the Sevillians, but lacking their ability to change color; it was a bright yellow over all of its body except for the pitch black eyes and the dark green Mark of the Curators on its back.</p>

<p>"Another asteroid?" Emma asked after we made introductions.  "How many of these things do you have?"</p>

<p>"You should properly ask how many <em>we</em> have since you have joined us.  The answer is six.  This station is responsible for all maintenance between the introduction of life and the Curation of multicellular life forms.  We deliberately trigger several important events if they do not occur naturally, and we also intervene sometimes when things take a bad turn.  Simple ecosystems are inherently perilous, responding poorly to external insults or feedback overshoot."</p>

<p>"How long do you stay at each world?"</p>

<p>"Our mission is very different from that of the engineers you recently met.  Congratulations on witnessing the Final Engineered Collision, by the way.  Once they identify a promising system they stick with it for tens of thousands of years, because once you start banging stuff around in a forming inner solar system it's not unusual to need adjustments often.  They will have thousands of systems on survey rotation when they're not engineering, mostly in easily identified stellar nurseries, and when they pick a candidate system for Curation it becomes their focus for some time."</p>

<p>"Our mission is a bit different.  Once the engineers turn a new world over to us, we add it to our private index.  We are Curating nine point three million worlds at this time, but few of them are visited more than once every few million years.  The closer a world gets to hosting a Critical Path species, the more often it requires attention.  At the stages where we are involved everything involves very long time scales so we are able to attend many worlds.  It would be unusual for us to prolong a visit to any individual world for more than a few weeks.  Since we have many to choose from we've put together a little tour that should give you an idea how our attention progresses as a world develops in these early aeons."</p>

<p>We were assigned quarters and told that our tour would last a couple of months.  The crew was again a wild mix of species, and this time several times more numerous than the crew of the engineering station.  "Dealing with living things, even simple ones, requires us to maintain laboratories and skill sets of considerable complexity," the leader said.  "Arranging your tour was easy because our usual pattern is to try to mix things up, so that everyone has a job to do with some regularity."</p>

<p>Food was served in a common hall but customized for the many individual species who were present; a similar arrangement prevails in capital fold ships.  The quality and attention to preparation detail were superb.  "Most of us will live a <em>very</em> long lifetime aboard this station," the leader said when we mentioned this.  "Our quality of life is an important consideration."</p>

<p>"When were the asteroid stations built?" I asked.</p>

<p>"We don't know for certain.  They are at least five billion years old, but we have no reliable records from those early aeons.  We have studied the matter and concluded that all the host asteroids were formed in the same solar nebula about nine billion years ago.  It would seem sensible to conclude that that was the home system of the Ancestors, but we have no proof of that."</p>

<p>"The Ancestors are the original Curators who evolved naturally?"</p>

<p>"Exactly.  I forget that you are so new to all of this."</p>

<p>"I wonder why they used asteroids," Emma said.  "Nobody uses asteroids."</p>

<p>"Our theory is that the Ancestors developed advanced fold technology before they developed nanites.  If you ask your implants -- I'm sending you a link -- you will find you have the skill of 'fold nibble excavation.'  This makes it very easy to turn a solid ball of rock or metal into a warren of tunnels and rooms."</p>

<p>Sure enough Emma and I both found our selves "remembering" how to execute this technique, which used precisely formed fold apertures to remove slabs of rock ten to fifteen centimeters thick from the end of a tunnel-in-progress.  This technique was not accessible to the Curated species because they did not have the precision fold technology enjoyed by the Curators, but it suggested that familiar modern nanite tech capable of cheaply building large ships was developed by the Ancestors some time later than their advanced fold tech.</p>

<p>Our first stop was a world that had experienced its own Final Engineered Collision only about fifty million years previously.  The solar system was still in the throes of what our scientists would call the "late heavy bombardment," and both the world and its moon were pocked with lava-filled craters from recent impacts.</p>

<p>"There is really nothing for us to do here," our host explained, "but we check in to see how it's progressing; we will use what we learn here to schedule our next visit.  Sometimes, if things are going badly, we might also refer such a world back to the engineers.  Sometimes we just learn that it isn't going to work out and cancel it from our index.  None of this is an exact science even for us."</p>

<p>After a few hours the head of the planetary astronomy crew made her report.  "Outer planet orbit inflation is a bit ahead of what the engineers expected, but not really a problem.  Density of impacting debris is decreasing on schedule.  The moon's orbit is looking good.  Water cover is behind schedule, but there is plenty of material left for delivery in the bombardment.  Overall, we think thirty million years is a good return date.  We should be able to get a better idea what the final ocean volume will be by then."  The mission leader entered that into a log and said, "Scheduled then."</p>

<p>"That's it?"</p>

<p>"There isn't much else we can do at this stage; this world is still receiving extinction level impacts several times a year, and it <em>needs</em> those impactors to deliver water and organic material which was driven off during the even more violent early days.  We mainly came to make sure there were no unfortunate mishaps developing.  Sometimes we find there won't be enough water, or that the relationship between the moon's orbit and the planet's rotation is unpromising.  Sometimes the outer system gives us an unfortunate surprise.  About ten percent of the worlds the engineers bring to this point turn out to be unsuitable and we either get the engineers to try to fix them or, if that's not possible, we give up and move on."</p>

<p>While the station had far better fold drives than even those humans had built, we were folding into systems that hadn't been visited for millions of years so we moved in cautiously, taking several survey days in the relative safety of the outer system before folding in toward the candidate world.  Our next target was further along, and while it was barren it glistened in places with full ocean basins and had no large open pits of lava.  The moon already strongly resembled Earth's Luna.</p>

<p>"This world received its moon three hundred million years ago," the leader told us.  "Its atmosphere is mostly water, sulfur dioxide, and carbon dioxide.  Tidal forces have slowed its rotation and pulled the moon upward to an orbit which makes the tides much less violent.  Our notes show that we had hoped life would have emerged naturally by now; it does about twenty percent of the time.  The atmospheric analysis makes it pretty certain that this hasn't happened, so you will get to see a seeding operation here."</p>

<p>Since the atmosphere was still quite toxic even to Curators, the life science crew conducted their survey in single-being personal flyers.  These were small enough that a Curator's implant could fold them a reasonable distance or generate a supergravity propulsion field sufficient for maneuvering.  The scientists spent several days surveying the world and several more deciding on an fertilization strategy.  Then cryogenic storage containers in the heart of the station were opened and carefully selected micro-organisms stored within were cultured to generate enough seed pods to give the operation a good chance of success.  Finally thousands of these pods were delivered to carefully selected surface sites and the original samples were restored from the cultures and returned to storage.</p>

<p>"We should return within a thousand years at the latest," the life science leader said, and the station leader entered this into their record system.  "By then it will be obvious whether the seeds have taken hold, and if they haven't we will have to determine why and whether to try again."</p>

<p>The next world we visited had been seeded about forty million years ago.  "In this case we are looking for signs of oxygen synthesis," the life science leader told us.  "Our ground crews are sampling atmospheric oxygen and also using spectroscopic samplers to look for mineral formations which might be acting as oxygen sinks.  If we don't find signs of oxygenation we will introduce cyanobacteria ourselves.  If we do we will look for the culprits to see if they are suitable for our purposes."</p>

<p>"If there's not much free oxygen, why not just go ahead and introduce your own cyanobacteria anyway?"</p>

<p>"At every stage our method is to give chance some time to work before we take action.  The Ancestors were clear that we should hope for evolution to surprise us before we impose our own order."</p>

<p>Emma and I looked at one another.  "I guess chance does happen sometimes," Emma said.</p>

<p>"More often than it would suit some of us," the scientist said and then he went on about his business.</p>

<p>After a week and a half of sample collection it was determined that there were oxygen producing organisms at work but they weren't nearly aggressive enough to transform the world's atmosphere in a reasonable time.  Accordingly, our hosts set about another seeding operation, overseen by a different group of scientists.  Apparently even the Curators have specialties.</p>

<p>"Our next destination was at this point about sixty million years ago.  Our records indicate that suitable bacteria had evolved on their own and were on their way to exhausting the natural mineral oxygen sinks, so on our last visit we took no action."  When we folded into the system we found the world cloudless and brilliant white.  "Iceball," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes.  A frequent result of oxygenation is that it oxidizes methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, into carbon dioxide, a less potent one, and the temperature drops.  Life almost always survives this but we have to wait for geological processes to introduce more carbon dioxide to get the temperature back up."</p>

<p>"You couldn't fix this in a shorter time?"</p>

<p>"Not really; the environment isn't suitable for oxygen-using life to start making carbon dioxide, and even if it was we really need more carbon on the surface, which we can get most easily by waiting for volcanoes to deliver it."  Another notation was entered into the records and we departed.</p>

<p>It was a little strange after Earth's unpleasant recent history with too much carbon in its atmosphere to see how stark a problem too little could also be.  The life scientists explained to us that at every level, from the single cell to an individual being such as ourselves to the ecosystem of a world, life was a series of interlocking equilibria that had to be maintained.  Maintaining those equilibria was what life did, and did excellently, but enough stress could cause those equilibria to collapse with dire consequences.</p>

<p>After we left the iceball world the leader didn't give us any hints as to what to expect next.  When we came upon the next Curated world after surveying its system from afar, it took our breath away.</p>

<p>Along with the brown and gray of rock it was also blue and green and the brilliant white of clouds.</p>

<p>"Let's survey it."</p>

<p>As flyers descended to the surface the leader explained.  "This is a world which may be ready to pass on to the next crew.  We want to establish that it has a stable ecosystem maintaining an oxygen-rich atmosphere.  The land will still mostly be barren but there will be a lot of life in the water, especially the ocean shallows and freshwater inland lakes and seas.  This is one of our most complex tasks and we will be here for about a month determining the diversity and extent of that life.  If we discover multicellular organisms, or determine that the environment is appropriate to support them, we will pass this world along to the next development crew."</p>

<p>They surveyed tens of thousands of samples, mostly using DNA techniques to sift for various gene sequences.  Their computers were much more powerful than even human machines at analyzing this data to determine the mix and development level of the life forms that had contributed to a bulk sample.  At the final summary meeting the crew leader announced that all the elements were in place for the world to develop its own multicellular life forms, but that the breakthrough hadn't quite happened yet.  In keeping with their policy of giving chance a chance, they decided to return in fifty million years to see if anything developed spontaneously before handing it over to be seeded with multicellular life.</p>

<p>Our tour was over, and we folded directly back to Terlingua where we found Quentin and the human-form Curator drinking scotch and playing pool in our underground lair.</p>

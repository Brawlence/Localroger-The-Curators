<p>"Your recovery here is impressive," the Curator said from behind me as I was eating lunch in
the lab's public picnic area.</p>

<p>"Too bad it was the buildings and machines and not the people we were able to salvage."</p>

<p>"True.  But I have news.  I have positively identified the people who did this."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"I believe we should involve your royals Jay and Emma too, as they will have an interest in my report."  I contacted them via the microfold and moments later the Curator and I folded to the royal palace.</p>

<p>"I was telling Andrew that your progress is impressive," he told Jay and Emma.</p>

<p>"We ran like cowards while our subjects died," Emma spat.  "There have been few good days since this happened."</p>

<p>"I know you don't want to hear my comment on that.  Know that I am sorry and am here to do my small part to atone.  I have identified the culprits."</p>

<p>"Tell us," Jay said.</p>

<p>"I know you remember the Curator who attempted to assassinate the two of you, who then went to Earth to make herself an unstoppable serial killer.  She was animated by the teachings of a Curator philosopher we call the Pessimist, who was active about four hundred million Earth years ago."</p>

<p>"Sounds like a cheerful guy," I said in anything but a cheerful tone.</p>

<p>"The Pessimist believed that our garden was doomed, that entropy affects living things as surely as it does particles and that our control would inevitably slip ruining our garden's carefully cultivated order.  He had a prominent position among the seeders of macroscopic life and his teachings are widely taken seriously."</p>

<p>"He was critical of many of the standard policies that guide our treatment of Critical Path species, and this as well as his focus of expertise kept him on the seeder asteroid stations and off the Critical Path teams.  But he had a following, particularly among those who worked with him.  At the height of his influence he announced that he was disgusted with the futility of waiting for it all to collapse and retired into emulation.  Nobody has heard from him since."</p>

<p>"But his followers are still around," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes.  Most of them are harmless, but there is a splinter group who call themselves the Plasma who believe that we must be more proactive to protect the order we have created as long as we can."</p>

<p>"The Plasma?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"Their chosen name refers specifically to an inverted particle energy profile which your scientists call 'negative temperature.'  They think this condition symbolizes the potential reversal of entropy."</p>

<p>"That's ... really stupid," Emma said.</p>

<p>"These people mostly work in the life sciences," the Curator said.  "They are very talented at what they do, but what they do isn't physics.  I've read their foundational manifesto, and I don't recommend it."</p>

<p>"I take it the Plasma don't like humans very much," Jay said.</p>

<p>"It would be fair to say that your emergence has galvanized them.  They consider you the living embodiment of everything the Pessimist warned them about, and their concern is that nobody is doing anything about you.  I have been able to prove that Plasma agents were behind your assassination attempt and all of the attacks on human worlds."</p>

<p>"You'd think they would be <em>happy</em> that we're leaving their galaxy," I said.</p>

<p>"Their problem with that is that you are practicing aggressive life extension without population control here.  They think you will overrun this new galaxy in a few hundred thousand years, and even if you don't immediately go back to the Milky Way you will eventually overrun the entire universe all around us.  After that if you ever do return it will be in such overwhelming numbers that we will have no chance to protect what we have made for ourselves."</p>

<p>"Has anybody forwarded them the studies that show prosperity slows human population growth?"</p>

<p>"At this point they don't seem to be interested in arguments from reason," the Curator said.</p>

<p>"I hope you realize how human this all sounds," Emma said.</p>

<p>"Oh, the irony is not lost on all of us.  The Plasma have decided that they require a level of control over the situation which our society does not allow them, so they resort to trickery and violence to get the results they want.  They have become exactly that which they fear, but I wouldn't waste my time trying to explain that to them."</p>

<p>"So where do we find these Plasma people?"</p>

<p>"I had some help with that, and the people who gave me that help want to meet you before extending that help to you.  A lot of the Plasma have roles within our Curation teams, because those work and social environments favor recruitment.  You will need alibis and introductions to move in those circles, and you can get what you need from the Homeless Council."</p>

<p>"Homeless Council?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure they will explain their charter and purpose to you.  I was told only to give you fold coordinates.  The world where their headquarters is located isn't on any standard index."  Jay, Emma, and I took the next shuttle to Earth, from which they were thirty-five thousand light-years away.  This is well out of single-fold range for even a Curator implant, so our implants mapped a route for us to hop between indexed worlds to get within range of our destination.  We triggered the sequence and after a few moments of blinking landscape changes we found ourselves in what looked like a public park.</p>

<p>"We're not there," Emma said.  "This is the last indexed stop."</p>

<p>But our implants knew why; we had been blocked pending authorization.  This wasn't done by a fold inhibitor but by software within our implants.  I hadn't noticed that such a mechanism existed in our probing of the implant at Terminus and I made a mental note to myself to check it out later.  Our implants were queried, and responded with our ID's and that of the Earth Curator who had sponsored us.  His ID met the authorization check and then we blinked once more into a typical town square style courtyard flanked by nanite buildings.</p>

<p>A door opened and a bright red scaly humanoid beckoned to us.  In siphilant Common he said "You must be the humans."  He gestured for us to enter.</p>

<p>He brought us to a group that was seated around a sunken conversation pit, and we accepted drinks which displayed a high skill at distilling.  "We seek a group called the Plasma," Emma said.</p>

<p>"Of course.  We helped your colleague to investigate their role in the violence against your species.  We all offer our deepest condolences on your losses at the world you called Terminus.  None of us here feel our kind had any business interfering with your affairs there."</p>

<p>"That's kind, but we doubt you understand what it is like to lose a world, and nearly all of your friends and family."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, all of us here understand it well which is why we are horrified enough to extend our help.  Surely your colleague told you what we call ourselves."</p>

<p>"The Homeless Council?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  It is a minimum requirement for membership in this advisory group that our birth worlds must no longer be habitable and our birth species must be extinct.  Of course that doesn't inconvenience most of us too much since it's been aeons since we wore a bioform of our birth species anyway, and the violent actor we usually have to blame for their extinction is the star that nurtured us in our species' youth.  We know the loss but we generally weren't taken by surprise."</p>

<p>"That is... you must have an amazing amount of experience between you," Jay said.</p>

<p>"Indeed we do.  But much of it has been watching the same thing happening over and over again.  This is an infamous event even by our long standards, and you do not have to explain to us why you seek the perpetrators.  But the Plasma are a thinly scattered group found all across our terraforming and critical path teams, and we have to wonder just who you want."</p>

<p>"We want those who gave the order to pursue this course, and those who carried out the implementation, both of the attack that destroyed Terminus and the attacks we foiled earlier on Terminus and the Earth.  We do not care about the armchair theoreticians and flag-wavers," I said.  Jay and Emma looked at me, and nodded slightly.</p>

<p>"Fair enough.  We then need to know what you plan to <em>do</em> with them, since all of us understand that it is impossible for any of us to destroy any others of us."</p>

<p>"We plan to make sure there isn't a sentient being in this entire galaxy who doesn't know what the Plasma did, and that they should not be allowed to ever work on any meaningful endeavour or access to any mechanism of great power ever again.  Our experience on Earth is that shunning can be a powerful deterrent, and we think it can be greater for those who live a very long time.  We would hope those responsible can be persuaded to retire into emulation rather than ever again show themselves in public."</p>

<p>"This would require you to make some of our unrelated affairs more public than we usually like," another council member said.</p>

<p>"This is true.  It is not generally understood that a Curator can be a violent psychopath at all.  A lot of people will find that upsetting.  But perhaps this is something the galaxy should be more aware of.  Perhaps that is what is necessary to deter the next attack, since as you say physical restraint isn't practical."</p>

<p>"I have a particular reason for taking your request seriously," the red-scaled Curator said.  "After a series of climate castrophes triggered by their warming sun, the people of my birth world chose to suicide <em>en masse</em> rather than endure an inevitable path of ever increasing privation and suffering toward extinction.  I did not learn of this until the decision had been finalized and the protocol carried out.  It was, untypically for one of this council's members, a surprise to me."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry," Emma said.</p>

<p>"It was a long time ago, but at the time it drove me into a deep state of depression.  I developed a bleak outlook on our whole galactic project and I wrote a number of monographs about my feelings.  To this day I am called the Pessimist for those writings."</p>

<p>For about five seconds none of us could think of anything to say.  Then I said "Our colleague said you had retired into emulation."</p>

<p>"I had planned to do that, but I later realized that would be a coward's way out.  And I did not anticipate my teachings being twisted into the very opposite of what I meant, which was that attempts at control are futile and that we should be more open about how we allow those we garden to express themselves.  But I have studied your species since you became so prominent and it seems you have your own experience with respected teachers who would not recognize their own teachings as later handed down."</p>

<p>"Yes, we've certainly seen that," I said.</p>

<p>"This is why, even though I don't think your ultimate scheme to shame the Plasma will work, I vote to let you try.  It is the least I can do for the role my words had in inspiring the murderers of your families, and I hold out hope that we may learn something from you, as we have already learned so much despite your relative youth.  I believe I speak for the group when I say that <em>none</em> of us here has an objection to the technological progress you have made or your efforts to share it with our other children."</p>

<p>"Hear, hear," several others said.</p>

<p>"If I could say one thing," one of the other members said, "could we ask that you avoid major disruption to our Curation operations?  It might seem satisfying to do to one of our asteroid stations what was done to your world, but..."</p>

<p>"We would never do such a thing," Emma said instantly.  "Perhaps if the Plasma had our remembered history of murdered innocents they would have also understood what a bad idea that sort of thing is, for so many reasons."</p>

<p>"Fair enough.  We discussed this before your arrival and agreed that, given his unwitting involvement in the affair, we would support the Pessimist's decision, and he has spoken."</p>

<p>There were nods, stomps, and other gestures of approval all around.</p>

<p>"All right then," I said.  "How do we find these assholes?"</p>

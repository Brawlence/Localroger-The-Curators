<p><em>Two Months Later</em></p>

<p>The Curators do not have a political system or hierarchy of power such as most species in the galaxy do.  They have trusted authorities who are given special powers by consensus; in the most rarified cases, such as control of amplifier belts or the guidance of critical path worlds, the consensus exists among other trusted authorities who are themselves appointed by what ultimately amounts to a consensus among a plurality of all Curators who have bioform hosts interacting with the natural world.</p>

<p>The meeting took place aboard the asteroid station that we had visited to witness the final engineered collision.  Two of the Curators work on that station shepherding the powerful and dangerous machinery of planetary engineering.  The other is the current final authority for distribution of amplifier belts, and he works closely with the planetary engineering group because at any given time they generally have a dozen or so amplifier belts in use.</p>

<p>The human form Curator had suggested the meeting in order to consider the misuse of an amplifier belt to attempt assassination of two Curators.  All of the participants had seen the recording of what our silver-furred supposed mentor had done to us after luring us to the stabilizing moon of Seville.</p>

<p>We were eavesdropping through our Curator's implant, which was not allowed and not supposed to be possible.  But when Emma unlocked his implant he discovered that a number of received truths that most Curators took for granted were, in fact, also locks.  It was not supposed to be possible to relay the proceedings of a group of Curators to an unseen outside party without their knowledge, but our Curator had discovered that this is indeed possible.  So we looked through his eyes and heard through his ears as he described the rogue Curator's plan and explained why in this case it had failed.</p>

<p>The Curators also didn't have the concept of crime or justice among themselves, since it was supposed to be all but impossible to kill a Curator.  It was this aspect of the misdeed that obviously grabbed their attention.</p>

<p>"Of course she will never have access to an amplifier again," the keeper of amplifiers assured everyone.</p>

<p>"And the young of any species may be more vulnerable than mature members," the lead planetary engineer added.  "It only comes as a surprise that emulation saved human J because no newly inducted Curator has been tested in this way for many aeons."</p>

<p>"Still, the best case even had they been mature is that they would have been forced to find new hosts, which would have left them vulnerable and ineffective for some time as their new hosts matured.  This could be an effective attack on some larger plan if they had been critical participants."</p>

<p>"This does concern us," the other engineer said.  "We must probe her motives.  Has she been notified of this meeting?"</p>

<p>"She is waiting for our summons.  Is there any other business before we question her?"</p>

<p>Our Curator quietly asked Emma and me if he should bring anything else up, and we declined.</p>

<p>She appeared, silver fur shimmering, and was obviously taken aback by the presence of the human form Curator.  "Oh, you're actually one of us," she said after a moment.  "Such an unreliable species."</p>

<p>"We were told that you were the last individual to see the two new human Curators," the head planetary engineer said.</p>

<p>"I was mentoring them in the ways of critical path guidance.  We folded away, presumably in their case home, from CI:1859229 after installing a tablet of writing there."</p>

<p>"Are you sure there wasn't another meeting somewhere else?" the amplifier keeper asked.</p>

<p>"Of course.  Why would there be?"</p>

<p>"Such as a meeting on the moon of exile world CI:1729140, which was only possible because you were wearing an amplifier to break through the fold inhibitor."</p>

<p>She betrayed a slight startle.  Then she became defiant.  "I don't know how you found out, but I was just doing what had to be done before it was too late."</p>

<p>"You betrayed a fundamental covenant by lying about your intentions for the amplifier, and you tried to kill two inducted Curators, an act which hasn't even been attempted for aeons."</p>

<p>"They were young and unformed, and <em>they weren't like us</em>.  Humans break their covenants all the time and don't even consider it a flaw.  They were crazy reckless agents of unpredictable change and you imbeciles gave them <em>our powers</em>.  If we had waited until a consensus allowed that a mistake had possibly been made it would have been far too late, so I acted."</p>

<p>"Your actions could also be brought to bear against any of us," the junior engineer said.</p>

<p>"We are backed up.  Any of us can find a new host.  There is no way they were fully backed up so soon after their induction, and I was counting on that to make sure they stayed dead, or at least came back incomplete enough to not be a threat."</p>

<p>"It was not your place to make and execute such a judgement," our Curator said. "Humans have a saying about that which makes it clear no one individual should be allowed such responsibility."</p>

<p>"Your own mind is addled by wearing that body for all these years and living among them.  These two <em>particular humans</em> were agents of one of the most dangerous and unpredictable changes ever made to the modern garden, introducing a new form of fold drive and, worse, making sure everybody in the galaxy can build it."</p>

<p>"Your hatred of innovation exceeds the boundary of sensible caution," the lead engineer said.  "Our Ancestors did not intend the garden to be a static place; we know that from their contemporary notes.  We have to consider that we may be the ones who need to learn.  The new fold drive offers opportunities to increase interaction between all of our children."</p>

<p>"Exactly!  And we are <em>helpless</em> to watch as it unfolds!"</p>

<p>"That is silly," our Curator said, and he had to go to some length to find an appropriate Galactic Common phrase to express the concept of <em>silly</em>.  "We are still the most powerful force in the galaxy by orders of magnitude."  (Silently, to us, he winked <em>for now</em>.)  "The new fold drive will be an opportunity for us to use our power to guide the developing changes, and most of all for <em>us</em> to learn something new about how innovation affects our garden.  Are we so jaded that we are afraid of <em>learning</em>?"</p>

<p>"You're just mad because I killed your friends," she spat.</p>

<p>"Oh no.  I am amused because after all the trouble you went to, you <em>failed</em>.  Jay was emulated and his emulation temporarily separated his implant from his body so that it could pass at sub lightspeed beyond the influence of the fold inhibitor, find a suitable projectile in the ring of the nearest gas giant, and hit the inhibitor with a relativistic impactor.  As a result the exile is broken and my friends are alive and safe."</p>

<p>Her eyes got far wider than what I thought her biology would allow, and she looked about at each of her interrogators, looking for some clue that this was a lie or hoax.  When she didn't find that she hardened and her eyes contracted to narrow slits.</p>

<p>"So that's how it is," she said.  "I was too late after all.  A <em>relativistic impactor</em> you say.  How many of us, even in our maturity, would have thought of <em>that</em>?  This is the force you have unleashed upon us.  Our garden is doomed."  And she closed her eyes and then fire jetted out of the sockets, her ears, and her mouth.  Her host body dropped to the floor, its brain incinerated.</p>

<p><em>What the fuck was that,</em> Emma and I both signaled our Curator on the back channel.</p>

<p>"Oh my," he said out loud.  Silently he added, <em>she burned her bioform</em>.</p>

<p>And with that the meeting was over, because there was nothing more to discuss.</p>

<p>Later our Curator met us on the <em>Nostromo</em> and this time we brought the booze.  Some of the scientists had set up an old-school still and were relaxing by teaching themselves the old art of plain distilling.  Their product was water-clear liquid fire and seemed an appropriate tribute to the silver-furred Curator in her passing.</p>

<p>"She's not gone, you know," the Curator said as he <em>very carefully</em> sipped his hooch.  "She's fully backed up and nobody can stop her from going anywhere in the galaxy and finding a new host.  If she ever exercises her Curator powers again in a public way we will be able to identify her through her implant ID, but she could come back anywhere in the galaxy."</p>

<p>"Then what was the deal with the fire in her head?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"We usually don't wait for our bioform hosts to naturally die.  We might get an assignment that requires a host of a different species, or just want a change of pace.  But the implant won't separate while the host is alive and functional.  That would create the possibility of the implant making two bioforms with the same personality, which we find ... repugnant.  So if you want to switch to a new host, you have to destroy your old one.  The process is consciously controlled and automatic once initiated."</p>

<p>Emma and I looked at one another; we were finding this in our unlocked pseudo-memories together.  We had simply not thought to <em>wonder</em> about such a thing.</p>

<p>"I also note that like letting you eavesdrop, voluntarily separating from my human host without killing it is one of those new abilities you have unlocked for my implant.  I am realizing that we have lived with some of these limits for so long that there may be none of us left who remember that they are artificially imposed.  Memories which are never exercised gradually self-erase and those of us who live the longest really remember little but the most important highlights of our early lives.  Put artificial blocks on the mundane records that don't self-erase, and eventually nobody remembers that they are even there."</p>

<p>We soon came to understand that the biggest reason we could trust him to keep the secret of our true activities at Terra Nova was that if our cover was blown, his enhancement would also be discovered, and he was learning things through it that few if any of his peers knew.  And through his reports we came to a much clearer understanding of what the other Curators were able and likely to do.</p>

<p>Even with foreknowledge of what we would need to do, the path ahead of us was daunting.  It didn't represent <em>billions</em> of years of advancement, because its advancement had effectively halted, partly due to those locks that had been emplaced while the Ancestors were still alive.  It may have represented a few hundred thousand years of active, curious research.  We came to suspect that it might even have been the limits they placed on their own technology that doomed the Ancestors when their ageing sun scorched their homeworld.</p>

<p>We had identified about twenty stages of new technology we would need to create, each dependent on the last being fully completed, in order to implement all the functionality of our implants.  Each of those stages would have been a major project on its own, and they involved some different and distantly related techniques.  But we would not be wasting our time on false starts, dead ends, or wondering whether the next stage was even possible before starting.</p>

<p>Fortunately we did not think the Curators would find it odd if we spent a century or two shooting the giants of Terra Nova.  They were very patient, they knew we were very proud and stubborn, and they would all be happy to see us wasting our time on something so futile and harmless.</p>

<p><em>36 hours later</em></p>

<p>Six ships were at rest on the surface of a new world, surrounding a new and empty city recently built by human designed nanites.  Now it was time to do the explaining.  The <em>Nostromo</em>'s ampitheater was full to overflowing, as were those on the other ships watching us by video.  Not everyone could fit in the ship ampitheaters so others were watching in smaller groups in conference and break rooms.</p>

<p>"Crew members of the expedition, welcome to the world we have called Terminus," I began.  "We apologize for the abrupt way you were brought here, and for those of us who wish to return to Earth or other places back home we promise that we will make that possible, not immediately, but probably within a few weeks.  When we have explained ourselves we think you will all understand."</p>

<p>"Twenty-two years ago after a rogue Curator tried to kill me and queen Emma, we went searching for a place where we could be safe.  Doing so required us to invent and prove new navigational techniques.  The Curators regard the Milky Way galaxy as their own garden, and many of them are upset at the things humans have done since we intruded on the order they had so carefully Curated.  They are tolerating us for now but the time will likely come when they will remind us that it is their garden, their home, and that they need us to follow their rules which we may not want to follow."</p>

<p>"Many of you will protest that the Earth is <em>our</em> home and <em>our</em> world, but the Curators do not see it that way.  They would say that they created the Earth as part of their garden, and as such it is theirs to Curate as they see fit.  And if we are not their proper children, then we are invasive vermin.  Many Curators, including the one who tried to kill Emma and myself, already believe that.  And we do not know enough about their culture to be sure those who disagree will ultimately prevail."</p>

<p>"Many of you will say that we should fight for our home, but having been given Curator powers ourselves we can assure you that as things are today such a conflict would be short and genocidal.  The Curators will fold Earth and every one of our colonies into their suns before they allow us to effectively resist them, and they have the means to do that despite our fold span limiters and inhibitors."</p>

<p>"Most of you know our true purpose at Terra Nova came to be to bootstrap our own version of Curator technology.  Despite the progress we have made we have far to go.  It might one day be possible for us to resist them without being annihilated, but we will then still have to consider whether such a conflict is worthwhile.  And meanwhile, should they find out what we are up to, we are certain that they would destroy us as soon as they suspect we might actually succeed.  They would destroy us with the same enthusiasm we would feel about rats or cockroaches that we discovered were somehow learning to use our own technology against us."</p>

<p>"We have accordingly left the Milky Way galaxy."  There were gasps from the <em>Nostromo</em> live audience.</p>

<p>"You might think we would have gone to Andromeda, but it turns out that Andromeda and the Milky Way are falling toward one another and will begin to merge within a billion years or so.  Such a time might seem unimaginably remote but the Curators have been active and keeping continuous records of their activities for <em>seven</em> billion years.  They are serially immortal.  They live in hosts of every species that can each live for hundreds of thousands or even millions of years with the mortality Cure.  But they can also transfer their consciousness to new hosts when it suits them.  A billion years is therefore not an unthinkable span of time.  We have made much progress on the mortality Cure ourselves, and it seems likely that within our new mortal lifetimes we will perfect serial immortality too."</p>

<p>"So even if none of us is likely to be here to see Andromeda and the Milky Way merge, it was clear to us that Andromeda <em>wasn't far enough</em>.  The Curators might still regard us as a threat if we settled there."</p>

<p>"Most of the galaxies of the Local Group are dwarf galaxies, which have low metallicity and are poor prospects for planets and the higher atomic weight building blocks of life and civilization.  The next best candidate in the Local Group is the Triangulum galaxy, but it is gravitationally bound to Andromeda and so likely to also become part of a single big elliptical galaxy along with the other two."</p>

<p>"So we searched farther afield.  Of several possibilities we settled on Messier 101, commonly called the Pinwheel for its appearance in Milky Way based telescopes."  A picture of M101 appeared behind us.  "It's a large galaxy of a trillion stars, much larger than either Andromeda or the Milky Way.  We don't particularly <em>need</em> such a large galaxy but we do need the heavy metals and planets with hot radioactive cores which seem to be more plentiful here.  Since leaving Terra Nova we have traveled twenty-one million light years.  We came here a few years ago to drop the nanites which have created Terminus City, and as you can all see they have done their job.  This was all made by our nanites, nanites which <em>you</em> designed, so we know there are no Curator back doors or secret secondary functions."</p>

<p>"When we scouted this galaxy we found over a dozen worlds which we regard as easily terraformable.  None of them is up the standards of a Curated world; Terminus for example has no stabilizing moon and no native multicellular life.  A couple of the others are iceballs, and several have not yet oxygenated their atmospheres.  But we have only surveyed a tiny fraction of this giant galaxy.  And as we perfect the rest of the Curators' tools for our own use, we may develop a more comprehensive plan for expanding our presence here.  We expect to have as much time as we need to make such plans."</p>

<p>"Some of you might be wondering whether the Curators will follow us.  It is unlikely that they will, at least soon, because it took us over a thousand successive folds to get here.  The journey was executed automatically by software that we designed for the purpose and requiring a ship to sustain us as a human-built fold drive executed the program.  The Curators have not used ships of their own for many aeons.  They are used to folding directly to their destination, or through way points that are either habitable or quickly skipped.  But there is nothing between the Milky Way and the Pinwheel but vacuum and zero-G for many hundreds of times their maximum fold range."</p>

<p>"Even if they use a ship or repurpose one of the few asteroid stations they use for planetary engineering, they will not be able to follow us through so many successive automated folds.  They will not know how to navigate when they get here.  And if they somehow come here on their own they will have no way to find the needle of Terminus in the trillion sun haystack of the Pinwheel.  We are confident that we will be safe here, and that this will remain true for some time even once we begin regular shuttle flights back to the Milky Way."</p>

<p>"Some of you may be wondering about the fate of those we left behind on Earth and its colonies.  That we honestly do not know.  But we do not believe the Curators know yet of our effort to re-engineer their technology; we left because their worry over the ability of one Curator to kill another had drawn them to us.  They were not worried about a threat from us.  But their investigation was placing them among people who did know too much of what we are really about here.  And we have been assured that if they did learn the truth, they would likely act without hesitation to destroy us all.  Leaving was the safest course of action to protect our friends and families as well as ourselves."</p>

<p>"There are twenty-seven hundred of us aboard these six ships, and we find ourselves at an empty city designed to accommodate fifty thousand.  You are all invited to explore and, if it suits you, reserve a residence.  Those of us who are running research projects are invited to find room for those in some of the warehouse spaces we had the nanites create for that purpose.  There are conversations to be had about which projects to leave on ships and which to ground here; we need to clear at least one ship of all new research labs so it can begin ferry service back to the Milky Way.  You will find Terminus City equipped with the usual data services you expect, although they cannot connect to sources back home because of the distance.  And we expect to keep all of the ships here for at least a month."</p>

<p>"I realize it is customary to take questions at this time, but we are scattered about our ships and most of the answers are either in what I just said or out there in Terminus City ready to be discovered.  We will have an in-person town hall there in two days' time.  Once again Emma and I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused some of you, but please take our word that we would not have taken this extraordinary step without warning if we did not think it was completely necessary."</p>

<p>"Welcome to Terminus City, the world of Terminus, and Messier 101 the Pinwheel Galaxy."</p>

<p>The ON AIR icon disappeared, the picture of the Pinwheel behind us went dark, and the ampitheater lights came up.  The mood of the audience was of stunned shock.  But then one person stood and applauded.  And then a few more.  And like a wave it spread, and those who were with us in person gave us a standing ovation.</p>

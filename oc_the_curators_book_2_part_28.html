<p><em>Eighteen Months Later</em></p>

<p>Our friendly Curator mostly went back to his job watching over the humans of Earth as if nothing unusual was going on.  Amusingly it seems that his colleagues thought he was a mole keeping an eye on us through his occasional visits to Terra Nova, while he was actually giving us detailed information on the differences between those implants which were still locked compared to our own.</p>

<p>He also traced the exact scope of the emergency protocol which had saved us at Seville, and it did indeed perform a blanket unlock operation in certain specific types of mortal bioform peril.  He believed that it had been introduced before serial immortality was very reliable, and before the locks had quite so much to lock out.  And like a great deal more, it had simply been forgotten.</p>

<p>Our biology guys completed synthesis of the first nanoassemblers, which were actually biological in form and rather fragile.  Then we used those to progress to making covalently bonded nanoassemblers and our first prototype self-replicating nanites.  This allowed us to bootstrap ourselves into the business of generalized nanoassembly very quickly, but we skipped what had obviously been an entire era during which the Ancestors had relied exclusively on the biological assemblers.</p>

<p>We had a team ready to start fleshing out our version of nanite tech even though nanites wouldn't lead directly to implants; other teams would be working on the biohelpers for the mortality cure and the bulk mass assemblers for making macroscopic objects.  But nanites would be useful in their own right.  When we finally outgrew the giant ships parked on the moon, we could set the nanites loose expanding our facilities as needed.  And <em>our</em> nanites wouldn't be encumbered by locks and back doors.</p>

<p>One day our Curator brought us a sealed envelope.  "I received this in the physical mail yesterday," he said.  There was no return address, and it was addressed to <em>King Jay and Queen Emma of Earth, c/o A Certain Human Curator.</em>  He found this odd because the identity of Curator agents was generally only known to certain high-ranking government officials and security officers.</p>

<p>I opened it.  It was hand printed in English.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Invasive Vermin,</p>

<p>I suppose my reprobate ex-colleague will be reading this over your shoulder; that is fine, as he should learn what you have created too.</p>

<p>Having lost all I ever believed in I realized that my only hope to understand what had happened to me would be to become as you.  So I came to Earth, and I sought a host.  But I did not seek an infant host as my kind do by habit.  No, I wanted to understand you as you exist in your maturity.  I wanted to feel your defiance.  And I wanted one of you who lives the truth of your existence, not one who hides your reality behind platitudes.  Fortunately your kind have stopped the practice of killing those of you who transgress those norms so many of you pretend to respect.  I found my host locked up in one of your institutions and when I offered him the opportunity to slip his bondage he did not ask much about what you like to call the fine print in my offer.</p>

<p>I let myself feel his emotions.  His pleasure in killing his mother was the most intense thing I have ever felt.</p>

<p>Human emotions are such a wonder!  He had such want and such need and such hatred but also so much fear.  When I whispered to him that I could give him powers, he did not care about my own purpose or that he will ultimately die.  I have given him the opportunity to experience more than he ever believed possible and when I burn him and move on he won't even care that little of him is incorporated into my backup.  His memories aren't of much interest anyway, being mostly of pain and fear and frustration.  The memories we are forming together will last.</p>

<p>You humans are certainly adaptable.  He has taken to being my host with a willingness and enthusiasm none of us would ever expect from a mature adult of an alien species.  He knows his world with a native agility none of us ever really learn.  But with my powers he can now evade all the limits that are placed on him by his own kind.  Is it not ironic that this individual can only be truly human when an alien gives him extraordinary powers to defy his own peers?</p>

<p>I did have to quickly understand how savagely he hates females before letting him know too much of my own true nature.  Freed from the locks of his society and its enforcement I have made it possible for him to do the only thing he really cares about, which is to kill women.  As he realizes how far beyond sanction he is now each performance is more savage and elaborate.  Having failed at my own only attempt to kill humans I take a quiet satisfaction in watching from behind his eyes as he realizes his mission.</p>

<p>He is of you, but he would kill you all for pleasure if it were possible.  We are even in fundamental agreement on this, because he has no designs on aliens such as myself; he only cares to kill those who created him, his own kind, that would be <em>your</em> kind.</p>

<p>I wanted you to know that you did not win.  That seems to be a thing with your kind.  Well you are back, and now I am back, and I am in your home raping and killing your daughters and mothers.  And when it gets to be too much of a problem I will burn this bioform, and he is already okay with the fact that I will have to do that sometime much sooner than thousands of years from now, and then I will go find someone else as representative of your species.</p>

<p>I am given to understand that there are human women who hate men as much as this male host hates women.  It might be interesting to ride one of them for awhile to see it from the other side.</p>

<p>Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm back and I'm not going anywhere.  Put a picture of me on one of your big birds before you shoot it.  I won't mind.  Nor will the girl I kill tonight.</p>

<p>Oh, and in the spirit of being human I have decided to adopt that silly custom you all seem to find so meaningful and take a name for myself.  You see, I realize that since I can't give my bioform hosts the Cure and I'm going to be encouraging them to transgress a lot of your supposed norms, I'll probably be switching bioforms frequently, and their names just won't do for these missives.  So...</p>

<p>Yours in glorious hatred,</p>

<p>--Nemesis</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"You have got to be fucking kidding me," Emma said.</p>

<p>"This is not good," the Curator added.</p>

<p>"When you said she could come back anywhere this is not quite what I expected," I said.</p>

<p>"She doesn't understand it at all," Emma said.  "Yes, we have people like her host, we've always had them, but we don't have many and we've always known about them.  That's why our society has systems to limit the chaos they can cause.  Laws, police, courts, prisons.  Like antibodies hunting cancer cells."</p>

<p>"How well do your antibodies deal with a cancer cell that can't be killed, can't be detected, and can move around invisibly changing its form?" the Curator said very seriously.  "If you brought this up to my people I can tell you exactly how they would react.  They would say there is nothing they can do about her.  And they wouldn't be eager to figure anything out, for the same reason they weren't happy with what she tried to do to you.  Because anything that would be effective against her could be used against them.  They would say it is Earth's problem, and as long as she stays on Earth the Curators would probably not care.  And I'm sure she has made this same calculation."</p>

<p>"You can't be serious," I said.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I am.  But maybe I have lived in this body too long.  I need to think about this.  Attend to your project here.  I will figure out how to deal with the rogue Curator."</p>

<p>"If your people as a group can't do anything, how can you as an individual?"</p>

<p>He tapped his temple.  "You gave me superpowers," he said with a rare smile.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure how much of an advantage you have over your peers," Emma said.</p>

<p>"Oh but I have learned much from you and your species," he said.  "It doesn't have to be <em>much</em> of an advantage, especially if it's one your opponent doesn't know you have.  I don't have any idea what I can do just yet, but I know I am probably the only being in the galaxy with a realistic chance of stopping her."</p>

<p>"You're letting your host's emotions out, aren't you?" Emma said suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Perhaps a little," he said.  "You are my friends, and this is a grave insult to your world which I am certain my people will not attempt to correct.  She does not expect any response at all.  Attend to your project, and let me consider my options.  The situation cannot stand."</p>

<p>We had acquired more white lightning from the Ph.D. distillers, and with that I got the decanter and some glasses and poured us shots.  "The situation cannot stand," we agreed as we watched him take on his mission.</p>

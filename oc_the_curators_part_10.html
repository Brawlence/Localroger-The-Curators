<p>M took us back to Pretoria, since that's where the <em>Grasshopper</em> was expected.  Fortunately M's landing spot and quonset hut were fairly remote from the airstrip's active area because I had to loan her my pajama top for us to get to her quarters.  M doesn't like to wear bedclothes.</p>

<p>"What I don't understand," she said as we were getting dressed, "is if they meant to steal <em>Grasshopper</em>, how they expected to get it back to their foldship.  It's the main reason we've gone unchallenged on all these worlds; with their nanite tech the aliens could get down with a little imagination, but getting back up from the surface without infrastructure is their big problem."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can help with that," a familiar voice said.  He just appeared in the room, like a ghost materializing where neither of us happened to be looking.  "I realize you want to report to your people, but at the moment I think it's rather more important for you to let us know what happened."</p>

<p>The Curator listened carefully as we related our story.  When we were done, he said "I am afraid we bear some fault for this.  We knew you were doing new things but we failed to warn you of some of the hazards you might encounter.  We really didn't expect for you to encounter raiders so soon, as their homeworld and usual operating theatre is half-way around the Wheel of the Galaxy.  But the news of your activities has traveled far, and they apparently decided your tech would be of benefit to them."</p>

<p>"Raiders?"</p>

<p>"Not such a young species, but much like yourselves, belligerent and capable of great selfishness.  The act of folding out the entire world when they realized they were doomed is typical.  We mourn the loss of so much of our effort, particularly knowing you were thinking of making use of the place."</p>

<p>"But you say they're like us.  Aren't we also a threat?"</p>

<p>"It is a matter of debate among us, but at the moment we favor waiting and seeing.  So far your kind are making your destiny, not stealing it from others.  I was greatly relieved that it wasn't your fold drive that annihilated the planet."</p>

<p>"We've worked hard to make sure our drives can't be detuned that way.  A few of our early ones still can, but we are scheduled to destroy them and replace them with more secure ones in the near future."</p>

<p>"See, that is a clear difference between yourselves and the raiders.  They really do not see how the threat they pose looks to other species.  You have individuals with that problem but you also know that <em>that</em> is a problem.  The raiders unfortunately have a thoroughgoing culture teaching that strength and victory are the only virtues."</p>

<p>"Great, space Vikings."</p>

<p>"They also resemble your fictional Star Trek Klingons."</p>

<p>"You mentioned earlier you had some idea how they planned to get <em>Grasshopper</em> up to their ship."</p>

<p>"Yes.  You noticed they don't believe in making orbit on a raid.  If they can conduct a raid in a few minutes, they can do it in the time their ship takes to fall only a short distance toward the surface.  And matching surface velocity instead of making orbit makes their operations fast.  It's much easier to get something to space than to orbit, as your species has learned to great precision, and the raiders have guided solid-fuel rockets capable of doing that job for modest payloads.  And strategically, it gives them an advantage because if their ship is over a city, you don't dare disable it even if you could.  Had their raid gone as planned, after killing you they would have strapped solid fuel boosters to the <em>Grasshopper</em> and flown it out of the atmosphere, where their fold ship could engulf it at low relative velocity before folding off."</p>

<p>"We have to get serous about building defenses," M said.</p>

<p>"We have to worry a bit about our other children."</p>

<p>"The raiders aren't coming for your other children," M said decisively.  "We have something they want and they know it.  And now we have to make sure they don't ever get it."</p>

<p>"You have spread yourselves a bit thin," the Curator warned.</p>

<p>"Only because we didn't know.  We have ten billion people.  We have over a hundred mothballed 747's waiting to be turned into starships, and we're making a fold drive every month now.  Tell me something, how many fold ships does the typical spacefaring species maintain?"</p>

<p>"Three would be considered an extravagant fleet.  They are like your naval aircraft carriers self-contained worlds.  Before this incident we believe the raiders had eight."</p>

<p>"I don't think we're going to be doing it that way.  If you don't mind, I think I need to get to Earth and talk to some people about this."</p>

<p>"By all means."  M stormed out, and minutes later I heard <em>Grasshopper</em> firing up.  "Ambassador, how do you feel about all this?"</p>

<p>"The raiders are murderous," I said.  "We used to be, and some of our individuals still are, but people like M are going to try to harness this power without giving it to the barbarians to use to burn the galaxy down."</p>

<p>"We will give you your chance then," he said.  "Just be aware that there is a certain point at which we will have no choice but to intervene, even if it means burning all of <em>your</em> works down."</p>

<p>I just nodded and he disappeared.</p>

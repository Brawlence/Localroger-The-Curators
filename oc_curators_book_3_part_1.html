<p><em>Sixty Thousand Years Ago</em></p>

<p>I was born into a tribe of nomadic hunter-gatherers.  They had a rich technology but 
it lay in the fashioning of stone points and spears and mastery of the atlatl.  My people 
had not yet invented the bow as a hunting weapon but they did use it to start fires.
And they lived by numbers.  They counted the days, they counted years, they counted
lunar cycles and they reckoned the passing of the seasons with a precision that would
astonish a modern human.  They reckoned our age in months rather than years
and I was 55 moons old when the big cat snatched me from the campfire.</p>

<p>My tribe had well made torches and they fearlessly set out after me, but the cat's
teeth were buried deep in my flesh.  The cat did not understand this fire thing that
made light in the night, and when my people caught up to it it dropped me and ran
for the darkness it had been expecting.</p>

<p>My people brought me back to the camp and the shaman did what he could and my parents
wailed prayers to the gods they thought might be listening but it was obvious they had
no way to fix what the animal had done to my small body.  In the middle of the night 
they simply left, leaving me to the wild.  It would have been more merciful had they 
killed me themselves rather than leaving me to die alone but I can understand why they
couldn't bear to do that.</p>

<p>My panic and terror were dissipating as I lost strength but then strangely out of 
nowhere I felt new strength.  When my fear reasserted itself a powerful internal 
voice told me, in a strange language that I strangely understood, that this was 
<strong>NOT USEFUL</strong>.</p>

<p>There were flashes of light that seemed to be chasing away the predators that wanted to
make a meal of me, and then one of the gods my parents had taught me about came to 
collect me.  It was an animal that stood on two legs like a human but was fully furred and had a 
long snout.  It scooped me up in its arms and then everything around us disappeared and
changed.</p>

<p>From that moment on I never lacked for any necessity of life.  My people had lived in
constant danger and privation; my tribe had made sure that I knew of the years when old people
had to walk away into the winter dark to make sure the rest of us had enough to eat.
But my new family had plenty of everything.  They always had good food and clean water 
and could make light and warmth anywhere they needed those things.</p>

<p>And whenever I wondered about any of it, I found that I simply knew.</p>

<p>I found that I knew the number 201442, which was the Index of the world where I had been
brought to mature in safety, and I also knew the number 1742660 which was the Index of the 
world where I had been born, and to which I would eventually return as an agent of my saviors.</p>

<p>I found that I knew all these worlds were arranged in the form of a spiral wheel called a galaxy,
and I knew a common language which would allow me to speak to any of the residents of 
those worlds, who were generally not gods but just mortal animals like myself with 
varying talents for technology.</p>

<p><em>I</em> was destined to be a god though.  I was being recruited to be a Curator, to join those
who tended the garden of the great Wheel and guarded its equilibrium.  I remembered
eighteen different lifetimes lived in bodies of different form and talent.  I remembered
nearly a million years of experience during those lives.</p>

<p>I remembered that emotions are dangerous and distracting and I remembered how to suppress
them when my human body insisted on distracting me.  I had been given a gift my parents
and my tribe could not even begin to imagine and I was intent on using it well.</p>

<p>It is one of those shortcuts of language that we say Curators take a new host.  What
actually happens is we offer that host the gift of our experience, and it even occasionally
happens that the gift is rejected.  But not in my case.  I accepted the gift of my implant's
memories and wisdom and the further wisdom and skill of the Curators themselves and swore
to do their bidding in a galaxy that was huge and confusing and sometimes unpredictable.</p>

<p>Particularly in the matter of un-Curated races such as <em>homo sapiens</em>.</p>

<p>I am human.  I am not an alien in a human body; I am a human with the memories of aliens
to draw on for guidance.  And I trusted that guidance for nearly a million years before
I found that it was sometimes foul.</p>

<p><em>4 Years after the Pinwheel Exodus</em></p>

<p>Sofia had put on a complicated winter outfit meant to be both warm and flamboyant, with
layers of insulation and colorful scarves.  As one of the researchers monitored the activity
of her experimental fold implant she picked a flower out of the tabletop arrangement and 
commanded a fold to our secondary lab in the new town of Outlook, over a thousand kilometers
away.  More researchers stood by there to witness and record the results from her arrival.
Sofia closed her eyes -- she insisted that she preferred to do this when folding -- and she
disappeared.</p>

<p>As did her clothing, which was no small feat.  And most of the flower.  The stalk had gone
with her, but the petals fluttered gently to the floor.</p>

<p>"Shit," said the researcher.</p>

<p>A moment later Sofia reappeared waving the now naked flower stalk.  She looked down at the
puddle of petals on the floor then waved the stalk and said "Really?"</p>

<p>"You definitely had the whole flower selected," the researcher said as he furiously tapped keys.
"Looks like the bug is on our end.  I'm gonna go look at the exit data."  He was wearing a much 
simpler outfit that he had practiced taking with him many times, and he just stood up and
disappeared.</p>

<p>Sofia was the only human so far outfitted with an experimental human-made fold implant who
wasn't herself a fold researcher.  She gave valuable feedback on how the user interface would
feel to a non-expert, and she was one of the few people at the Pinwheel who could actually
make use of her ability.  Human implants could fold themselves into fold bubbles like Curator
implants, but as material objects they were only about half a meter across.  They didn't
implement any of the personality backup and host-taking functions of the Curators' version,
nor were they capable of interstellar range yet.  But it was handy for Sofia to be able to
pop back in to a colony world from its outer solar system when we were exercising our hobby
of supplying new human worlds with stabilizing moons.</p>

<p>"I thought the safety mechanism wouldn't break a chemical bond," she said.</p>

<p>"Obviously something about how the petals are joined to the stalk isn't as expected.
But it shouldn't have mattered, the petals were selected and it should have taken the whole flower."</p>

<p>Human implants also had to take some liberties with things like hair.  Curator implants
created a fold aperture that closely followed every strand of hair; they had been made for
species that might have extensive fur.  Our implants marked off a minimum encompassing volume
that was prevented from giving us haircuts by the safety mechanism.  This meant we tended to
take a little air with us when we folded but there were mitigating techniques to deal with that.</p>

<p>At the moment our priority was perfecting the user interface, which was also still crude.  But
our teams were making good progress, and that aspect of our design was almost usable.  The next
step would be to ramp up the size to increase aperture resolution and range.</p>

<p>"At least it's been awhile since I arrived naked," Sofia said.  A year earlier that had been a
frequent failure mode.  It was now only complicated or unusually formed clothing that sometimes
got left behind, and they were steadily making it easier for the implant user to select the 
items to be folded with their body.</p>

<p>"I don't know, I think the arriving naked bug was kind of fun.  Especially when it happened to
you."</p>

<p>"Yeah Mr. Genuine Curator Implant, I never got to see <em>you</em> pop in in your birthday suit."  And
with a sharp laugh she threw the flower stalk at me.</p>

<p>I also spent quite a bit of time assisting the surveyors as they scouted for more potential
human worlds; with my amplifier suitably reprogrammed I could add hundreds of cubic light-years
of space to our growing map and pinpoint targets for detailed exploration in a few hours.
I didn't bother with on-site exploration myself; I just brought the map extensions and target 
coordinates back to Terminus, where humans with ships would be assigned to do that more 
time-consuming task.  There were now over thirty worlds considered promising for relatively
rapid terraforming, and four where humans could live out in the open without life support.
All the worlds had research stations and over a dozen had permanent colonies, though most 
were of less than a thousand people.</p>

<p>About once a month the <em>Palomino</em> shuttled back to the Milky Way and generally returned with 
around a thousand new recruits to our project.  We could have brought many more but the whole
thing was kept as quiet as possible back home to minimize the chances that the Curators would
hear of it.  Recruitment was by private message and word of mouth, and none of the new people 
who boarded the <em>Palomino</em> knew where they were going when it left Earth.  Fortunately when 
they learned that the mortality cure was part of their reward for joining up very few of them
wanted to go back, and we were always able to accommodate the few that did by bringing the 
people they would miss on board too.</p>

<p>It was the year 2218 according to Earth's calendar, and Jay was 202 Earth years old.  The
human population of the Pinwheel galaxy was nearly fifty thousand, about half of them on
Terminus and the rest scattered among the other worlds we had discovered.  And there were
more worlds being found and more people arriving all the time.</p>

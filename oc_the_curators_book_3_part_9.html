<p><em>Twentieth Century CE</em></p>

<p>The story of human ascendance has, unfortunately for many individual humans, been
the story of human power.  Not having the nanite-based economy of plenty to provide
their needs, when humans wanted more than they could acquire by hunting and 
gathering they had to start by acquiring power over other humans in order to marshal
the labor resources they needed to do what the nanites could have done.</p>

<p>We human Curator agents were directed to study human nexuses of power, in order to
verify the Curators' prediction that humans would ultimately destroy themselves.
This study took us to many places and times.  We were there in China, and in mesoamerica,
and the Indian subcontinent and of course in Africa.  But the chain of power that led to 
humans' explosive technological expansion began in Mesopotamia with an idea that the 
leaders of men somehow attained their authority from the gods that men had invented to
explain how their world worked.  This led through the Greeks to Rome with a side trip 
to Egypt, and then to the creation of the Christian church in a really crass political
move to undermine the pagan religious leaders of the Roman empire.  </p>

<p>The Church then survived the empire that had created it and for a millennium it was the 
absolute power of Europe, more powerful than any monarch, until both military advances
and observations of secular reality began to chip away at its authority.  At first when
the monarchs sent their soldiers in caravels to conquer the world they took priests
with them, but gradually the empires became the real powers over most of the Earth and 
the Church of Rome became a venerated but mostly impotent relic.</p>

<p>But then even the idea of monarchy began to lose its divine lustre.  Finally in an era
of global trade made possible by ocean-going ships and railroads and the new factories
powered by new machines, capital and those who managed to control it became more powerful
than even monarchs.  Just as the Pagans and Christians had jostled for position before 
Constantine made the move which created the Catholic Church, in the 19th century it was
capital and aristocracy which vied for power.  And nobody realized that the aristocrats
were doomed.</p>

<p>Insinuating myself into the presence of the new capitalist movers and shakers without
actually helping them required some creativity.  I started by associating myself with
artists as a student who was never quite good enough to be remembered for my own work.
My association with people like Matisse and Picasso got me invited into the presence of
their patrons.  I made myself into an inoffensive student who was liked because I listened
well, and I heard much.  I was there when ground was broken on great museums and 
libraries and on vast industrial and civil works.</p>

<p>But then knowing what the situation was, I was also there within days to trace the 
consequences after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.</p>

<p><em>Present Day</em></p>

<p>Veronica whistled as she regarded the Curator implant on its research pedestal.  "So
now I have one of these inside my <em>head</em>?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, there is a dimensionless point that is probably within your thalamus now which
connects to one of these in its separate fold of space-time.  There is no danger of
it suddenly popping out.  It was a <em>major bother</em> to get this one back into our
universe."</p>

<p>"So what are the black dots?"</p>

<p>"Holes we've drilled with special nanites to study its molecular circuitry.  We're
trying to keep it as intact as possible so it continues to function as we study it.
Fortunately the Curator circuitry is very highly redundant."</p>

<p>"So this is how you figured out how to make the B-list ones?"</p>

<p>"No, we actually figured those out all on our own.  This is about figuring out the
more advanced functions, personality backup and taking new hosts.  Their user 
interface is also a lot more advanced than ours."</p>

<p>"I'm noticing that," she said.</p>

<p>"There's something else," I said.  "In order to make bulk nanoassembly work we had to
make some compromises.  There are always flaws, and that's why we only have four
ping-pong ball sized fold drives after over a hundred tries.  The ones we are making
now are a bit bigger but we can back up and do rework to correct the flaws as we 
make them."</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"The Curators don't seem to have done that.  This thing was made like the ping-pong ball."</p>

<p>"And you tried a hundred times with a four percent yield?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How did they ever make one of <em>these</em> work?"</p>

<p>"We think they did it very slowly in conditions of extreme cryogenic cold and 
mechanical quiet.  We were considering that approach ourselves before our 
engineers thought of the faster rework techniques.  It might have taken them
a thousand years, or even ten thousand, to make this thing."</p>

<p>"And how long did it take you to make my B-list implant?"</p>

<p>"About ten days."</p>

<p>"And it was almost a meter across."</p>

<p>"Made like the ping-pong ball or this thing it would have been about twenty 
centimeters, but once these things fold off into their bubbles it doesn't
matter how big they are as physical matter."</p>

<p>"You're saying that we're already ahead of them."</p>

<p>"On this.  One of many dimensions."</p>

<p>"But <em>we're ahead of them on something</em>.  Already."</p>

<p>"I'd say so.  For our purposes at least our technique promises to be much
more practical than whatever they did."</p>

<p>"Wow.  They're fucking doomed, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily yet, but we're working on it."</p>

<p><em>Three Months Later</em></p>

<p>Veronica made her way from the Sydney spaceport to the Red Estate via back
roads and paths which had been mapped for her by Red's associates.  She
was in a levitating groundcar so she could do a bit of offroading.
Because Earth bought its gravity plating from aliens it was expensive,
and a lot of shipping conveyances still ran on wheels for economy so there
were roads for them.  But most small vehicles could levitate and the roads 
did not fan out with the granularity they had in the twenty-first century
to reach every single residence.</p>

<p>Callie's papercrete dome was on a road so that she could reach it
with her "hobby truck" which wasn't supposed to be able to fly.
But there weren't many roads, and Veronica's
offroad route was much faster than following them.</p>

<p>"No alarm," Veronica said when Callie answered the door.  "Just a little
gift."  The sphere was heavy so Veronica brought her to the boot of the car
and asked her to grasp it.</p>

<p>"I know what this is and I'm not supposed to have one," Callie said.</p>

<p>"Special consideration.  Andrew has approved it.  The fold function is
locked and you need a key to enable it, but you will be able to use the
microfold senses to communicate with our agents and the defense network.
Nobody can detect that activity at a distance."</p>

<p>Callie accepted the implant.  Then she asked, "What's the key?"</p>

<p>Veronica reached into the vehicle's glove box and brought out a hinged
wooden box.  Inside it was a single silver sphere and a depression for
another that was missing.</p>

<p>"It should match your fold drive," she said.</p>

<p>There are a little over three million registered capital fold ships in the Milky Way galaxy.  Of these, about one in five run a regular route called an orbit, visiting the same worlds in a sequence that regularly brings them home to start over.  Orbits might take a ship to as few as five or six worlds or as many as fifty; the average is around thirty.  We carefully selected about forty thousand of these carriers to be our final delivery assistants, breaking down the half-dozen pallets they would be supplied with to deliver one set of volumes to each world they visited, a gift that was easily accommodated by the usual orbital transports.  These ships would visit nearly every world in the galaxy, and a mop-up direct mission concluding our project would take care of the stragglers.</p>

<p>If we had to supply those forty thousand carriers ourselves, it would take us nearly a millennium.  A fraction of the regular carriers maintain scheduled orbits so that they can reliably share rendezvous with a few other ships as they travel; this allows for heavy cargo to be transferred in space without de-orbiting and waiting for the other ship to arrive.  This of course is exactly the service we needed, and we recruited about ten thousand second-tier helpers which would be supplied with enough books for their own orbital destinations as well as all those of the other ships they planned to meet.  These ships would each take on twenty or thirty pallets.  Everything was pre-labeled as to which ship was to pass it on to which other, and which final world each volume was addressed to.</p>

<p>If we directly supplied these second-tier helpers the project would still take between one and two centuries, longer than we wished.  So we also recruited about two thousand first-tier helpers who would rendezvous with the second-tier helpers; they would take on as many as 150 pallets.  This would require ten to twenty thousand square meters of cargo floor space; while that might sound like a large imposition it really isn't for a capital fold ship.  Our partners were all enthusiastic and were training staff to execute the transfers and deliveries even as we loaded the <em>Reliant.</em></p>

<p>Supplying all of the first-tier helpers would take about thirty years, but we would also be running three ships in tandem so that it would only take ten.  The <em>Alexei Leonov</em> was already waiting in orbit to take <em>Reliant</em>'s place for loading after we cleared the staging area.</p>

<p>These missions would be absolutely unique in both human and galactic history.  Together the three ships would travel within five hundred light-years of every point in the galaxy where inhabitable worlds might be found.  They would be away from Earth for the full ten year mission, shattering the records for both longest and most distant away mission ever conducted.  They would be stuffed not only with books but with recording devices operated by some of humanity's best scientists.  The missions would also each take about a thousand tourists hungry for the opportunity to literally go where no human had ever gone before.  Most of these people would not stay out the whole ten years, as more modest passenger-class fold ships would regularly commute between the book carriers and the human colonies allowing passengers to come and go.</p>

<p>One goal of these missions other than book delivery was to create a <em>human</em> index of the galaxy, which would actually list every star, not just the Curated ones, in the parts of the galaxy where it was safe to fly.  Accordingly we would be making short stops in interstellar space between our destinations in order to take quick scans to fill in as many gaps as possible.  For the benefit of both the scientists and the tourists we also had side trips scheduled to a few places that wouldn't harbor life, but were of intense interest for other reasons.</p>

<p>Emma and I joined the expedition in our personas as King and Queen, and our departure was choreographed so that we could watch the <em>Leonov</em> descending to take our place.  Within a day we made orbit at CI:1146020 to wait for their ship 1146020:5, which took on 138 pallets to bring the Promethean drive-making methods to 692 other worlds.  Emma and I personally delivered a copy to the surface of CI:1146020 itself, where we were greeted with applause and treated to a lavish party.</p>

<p>Instead of continuing with <em>Reliant</em> Emma and I jumped ship to follow the <em>Five</em>, as its crew called it.  The pallets had been carefully staged so that the twenty-seven meant for Tier 2 helper 526900:8 were on the outside of the storage area.  The pallets were equipped with remotely controlled gravity plating skids, and transferred from one enormous airlock to another in vacuum.  They also transferred quite a bit of other cargo; this was a function we had never actually seen before since we had our own methods.  It was shocking to realize we were ignorant of such a basic function of standard galactic commerce.  We really did tend to stay in our own little bubble of civilization.</p>

<p>Once again we jumped ship to follow the <em>Eight</em>; we were assured that this was a very common form of shorthand affectation for the crews of fold ships, most of whom lived aboard for years at a time and came to consider the ship more of a home than their homeworld.  The Eight made four stops where we broke the pallets labeled for that purpose and delivered volumes to the surface, then we stayed in orbit at CI:1004917 for nearly a week waiting for the 1004917:2 to complete its orbit.</p>

<p>While we waited we delivered their instruction volume to the eager staff of an already-built fold shop facility.  As we watched about twenty of them took seats at a long table, and the first volume was separated at one end.  The pages were passed down the line to be read by each individual, and then at the far end of the table they were reassembled.  This "reading line" was a suggestion that had been compact enough to make it in over the microfold, and we were assured that it was the most efficient way to familiarize the most individuals with the overall content of the manuals in the shortest time.  The readers would obviously not retain enough details to be able to start work, but they would have some idea where to go when they needed that detailed knowledge as they built their shop.  The readers took notes and discussed each page with their neighbors, and passed the pages along at the sound of a chime which allowed generous time to read and discuss each page.</p>

<p>This time when the 1004917:2 arrived we only transferred four pallets, one of which was only half full, with a volume for each of the twenty-seven worlds it would visit before returning home.</p>

<p>And wanting to see how the process played out to the end, we again jumped ship.  This time we were surprised to find that the crew did not call their ship the <em>Two</em>.  Instead they called it <em>Eyes</em>, which we eventually figured out was a slang term for a result of two in an ancient and popular gambling game that involved flipping ceremonial coins.  Since there were no more bulk transfers we stayed with the <em>Eyes</em> for its entire orbit, personally delivering each volume.</p>

<p>While we were aware of the range of body styles among Curated species, it was a new thing to see so many of them on their native worlds in such a short time.  Most of them thrived only on a relatively small part of their world for which they were adapted; some of them had specialized protective gear for exploring more extreme environments, but none of them lived in such environments permanently or even for long periods the way that humans do.  Some, like our hosts, had been making preparations to try making a fold drive before we arrived; others thanked us and showed us how they would put our gift in secure storage until they could recruit guides who could help them use it most effectively.</p>

<p>We came to understand that in these early days, the most valuable product of a fold drive shop wasn't going to be a fold drive.  It would be the trained personnel who could go to other worlds and help them spin up an operation quickly without making mistakes or missteps.</p>

<p>It would take millennia for the Promethean methods to achieve full penetration.  Three million plus existing capital fold ships were effectively obsolete, and Promethean technology would make possible new classes of smaller and more numerous long-range craft that could land on any world.  It would no longer be necessary to transfer cargo in vacuum by remote control, and landing would make direct rendezvous unnecessary for large-scale commerce.  Entirely new forms of commerce would become practical.  All over the galaxy there was an electric feeling of change in the air, a larger change than the galaxy had seen in aeons.</p>

<p>And while we had some help from the Prometheans, it was mostly humans who had done this.  The Prometheans would not have developed their more accessible drive if we hadn't taught them the secrets of our more difficult to build version, and they did not have the means to publish what they had learned for the benefit of the entire galaxy.</p>

<p>After we returned to CI:1004917 we went for a quiet walk on the outskirts of their capital city and, when nobody was looking, folded home to Terlingua, state of Texas, Earth.</p>

<p>As we poured celebratory shots of some alien liquor our Curator friend had left for us, Emma sighed.  "You know," she said as we clinked our shot glasses, "I keep thinking of that operation to make a moon.  I can't help wondering what happens next.  I know we are supposed to actually live long enough now to think of projects on that scale, but... somehow it doesn't seem real."</p>

<p>"I know," I said.  "We've done something here that everyone thinks is extraordinary, and then you compare it to <em>that</em> and it's like, really?"</p>

<p>"I want to see what happens next," Emma declared.  "I want to see the whole process.  They might not have finished the job for whatever reason but for practical purposes the Curators still created us.  They created our world, our biosphere, our ancestors, and the whole environment that in turn created us.  I want to see how and why they did it."</p>

<p>"Well you know who we have to ask about that," I said, and we nodded in agreement.  A few moments later our friend the human-form Curator popped into existence right in front of us.</p>

<p>"I remembered not to bother hiding this time," he said with a grin.  "And I brought more refreshments.  I hope the <em>untranslateable</em> was to your liking."</p>

<p>"It's fine," Emma said, and then she stated her business.  The Curator nodded.  "I had a feeling it might have that effect on you, so I've already made some inquiries," he said.  "The kind of work you are now interested in isn't as spectacular, and it is ongoing, so fewer of us want to see it and it is easier to get a guided tour.  Let me finish making some arrangements.  Not all of us are pleased with what you are now doing, so we have to be a little careful about who to approach."</p>

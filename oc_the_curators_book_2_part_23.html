<p>I could not figure out where I was.  I was conscious, and in fact I felt very alert, but I had no senses and couldn't feel my body.  I was also aware that I should have been a bit more upset by this than I was, but I also didn't seem to be feeling strong emotions like fear or panic.  The last thing I could remember was preparing to deliver the tablet of writing per the Curator's direction.</p>

<p>I was aware of my Curator implant, but much of what it would usually be telling me was blank or off-scale.  I wondered to myself what the hell was going on, and like a memory a thought floated into my mind:</p>

<p><em>Engram synchronization could not be completed.</em></p>

<p>That felt like my thought but it obviously was not, and that's the way the implant usually delivers requested information.  The Curators didn't want the implant to feel like another separate being lurking within one's mind, even though that's very obviously what it is in many important ways, but interactions with it are made to feel like one's own thoughts and feelings.  I had the impression this thought about engrams would convey important information if I had any idea what it meant.</p>

<p>Since it was something I could sense I took inventory of the fold situation and finally recognized one of my circumstances; I was in the field of a fold inhibitor and it had shut down most of my implant's functionality.  I could still fold a short distance but all sorts of alarms twitched when I thought about trying it.</p>

<p>And that didn't explain why I seemed to be disembodied.  I wondered what was up with that, and got another answer:</p>

<p><em>The bioform is incapacitated.</em></p>

<p>It wasn't like having a conversation; if I thought of questions they went unanswered.  But if I <em>wondered</em> about something, sometimes it felt like I just <em>knew</em>.  I wondered why the bioform was incapacitated.</p>

<p><em>The local environment is in vacuum.  The bioform has vacuum defenses but they are unfamiliar and the prognosis is unknown.  There is no safe destination to fold to within the range imposed by the inhibitor.</em></p>

<p>And what about Emma?</p>

<p><em>The companion bioform is also incapacitated by the vacuum environment.  Her implant is in ready mode and requires her conscious interaction to take action.</em></p>

<p>But if she was unconscious, what was happening with me?</p>

<p><em>This implant recorded sufficient engrams to perform emulation under the threshold established for emergency action in a bioform-mortality situation.</em></p>

<p>So that was it.  I wasn't actually Jay.  I was the implant <em>emulating</em> Jay.  This was odd because I certainly felt like Jay and remembered a lot of Jay's life, but there were also conspicuous gaps; in particular I couldn't remember much at all of my medical training.  I vaguely remembered our mentor telling us of this capability when we received our implants.  But wasn't it supposed to take a thousand years or more to become enabled?</p>

<p><em>Engram synchronization is highly variable and sometimes reaches threshold much sooner, particularly under emergency situations.</em></p>

<p>So the situation was an emergency.</p>

<p><em>Loss of the bioform is to be avoided if possible.</em></p>

<p>I found that I wasn't completely blind; I could sense my environment within a hundred meters or so, and understood that I was indeed on the surface of a low-gravity airless world, almost certainly the stabilizing moon of a Curated world.  I could also sense the strength of the inhibitor field by its effect on my capabilities.</p>

<p>I had to find the damn inhibitor.</p>

<p><em>Separation from the bioform is to be avoided but emergency protocols allow it via override.</em></p>

<p>Would I be able to reconnect?  </p>

<p><em>If the bioform is returned to safety reconnection will be automatic.</em></p>

<p>I overrode the interlock and separated from my human body and found that the fold inhibitor didn't impede my ability to navigate in normal space.  I could go almost the speed of light, because without my body my point of contact with the material universe was a massless point.  Of course this also meant I had no way to interact with the world since all my implant's modalities were fold based.  I set up a hill-climbing area search algorithm and spent about half an hour locating the inhibitor.</p>

<p>It was about a quarter of the small world's circumference away from where I had awakened.  I knew that I could find my way back with great precision; though I didn't know where I was, I did know how I had gotten from where I started to where I was now.</p>

<p>I had no way to affect the inhibitor though.  I couldn't disrupt its power or damage it and if it had a user interface I had no way to operate it.  I had to get out of the inhibitor field and figure out where I was, so I shot straight up from the inhibitor site at about eighty percent of the speed of light.  It took fifteen minutes to reach the edge of the inhibitor field, which was a little more than an astronomical unit in radius.</p>

<p>And then, just as suddenly, I knew where I was.  My fold senses couldn't feel Seville or its moon or sun or the inner planets of its system, all of which were within the inhibitor field, but I knew where I was in the universe and I could feel the outer planets which matched my very implant-precise expectations.</p>

<p>I could now fold to any point in the galaxy, but none of my options were all that promising.  Fortunately I seemed to be thinking very fast.</p>

<p><em>In normal circumstances emulation is paced to the natural rate of thought, but in emergency protocol it can run fifty to eighty times faster.</em></p>

<p>I could go for help, and I could probably even communicate by taking over a microfold channel, but even if I could attract help and bring them to Seville they would be just as stuck as I was.  Traveling an astronomical unit through normal space without fold technology to decelerate would take weeks.  And while Emma's experience when the <em>Plausible Deniability</em> had blown out showed that we had at least a few hours, we knew from the Witnesses that we had at most a day or so before permanent damage would set in, and no more than two days at the outside for our bodies to survive.</p>

<p>I still didn't have any idea how we had <em>gotten</em> to the middle of an inhibitor field, and my implant had no ideas when I wondered about it.  But it didn't matter; much of what was me was still locked up in brain jelly and both the implant logic and my emulated consciousness were strongly motivated to get it back.  Not to mention that I really wanted to also save my wife.</p>

<p>After excluding a long list of things that were obviously unworkable I decided to start by asking myself what was at hand.  I could easily and precisely navigate the outer Seville system, and without my bioform as part of the package I could fold a payload of several hundred kilograms within that range.  I could project energy from the heart of some star other than Seville's but I couldn't collimate it well enough to be a useful weapon at a range of a hundred and fifty million kilometers.  And I could use supergravity to accelerate things...</p>

<p>That created an option.</p>

<p>I folded out to the closest gas giant, confident that it would have a ring; it did, and I spent half an hour or so shopping for a suitable chunk of ice.  It couldn't be too big for me to fold in-system but it had to be as big as possible within that limit to be effective.  When I found what I wanted I folded back to the point where I had emerged from the fold inhibitor field.  I was confident that I was within centimeters of where I would have been if I had simply kept my original velocity vector from the world where my body was trapped.</p>

<p>Seville's moon would be curving around Seville in its orbit, and Seville itself similarly curving around its host star, but in the course of a few hours those departures from a straight line would amount to at most a few meters.  It was maddening considering that I could locate points on worlds circling other stars to within millimeters, but the situation was the situation.</p>

<p>I aimed as accurately as I could, and opened a microfold supergravity portal to the Sagittarius X1 black hole.  The strength of the gravity field and high velocity affected my accuracy even more but I only needed to be within a few kilometers back at the moon.  When I stopped pushing the ice chunk it was moving at about a third of the speed of light.</p>

<p>I raced ahead of it back to my body, and waited.  The implant wanted to reconnect but its protocol would not require that until I got my body to a place of safety.  When my ice block struck I knew instantly that it had hit about eight hundred meters from the inhibitor, which had then been vaporized in the impact fireball.  Now a plume of white-hot molten ejecta was rising to blanket the moon.</p>

<p>This introduced a new problem.  I could fold my body to another star system, but once I did that my implant would reconnect and I'd be unconscious for a few hours while my vacuum defenses abated.  Meanwhile Emma would be buried under flaming debris.  There was only one place where I could fold both of us that was habitable, and that was the world of Seville itself.</p>

<p>Fortunately I had an idea where I might be able to take us where the natives wouldn't be likely to stumble across our unconscious bodies as we recovered.  I didn't know how a Sevillian would be likely to react to the sudden appearance of one of those humans who had exiled them.</p>

<p>I folded us over several minutes before the whole area was pelted with molten rock.</p>

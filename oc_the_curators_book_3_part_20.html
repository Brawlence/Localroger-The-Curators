<p>There were very few human-form Curators and Jay and Emma were well known across the galaxy, particularly among the seeders because of their studies and the assassination attempt.  Considering that we also did not know else who we could confidently trust, it would fall to me to insinuate myself with the Plasma and trace their organization.</p>

<p>"Is that really going to be our plan?" Emma asked when we were back on Earth.  "Publicly identify and shame them?"</p>

<p>"Of course not," I said.  "That was what those guys needed to hear.  I am going to identify every last one of them for myself and I then I am going to methodically send every last one of them to visit my darling Sofia."</p>

<p>"That sounds more like it," Emma said.</p>

<p>"And you?" I asked Jay.</p>

<p>"This is war," he said.  "Do what you have to do.  And call on us without hesitation if there is the slightest chance we can help."</p>

<p>I couldn't risk having my amplifier detected so I left it in Emma's care when I departed.</p>

<p>My cover was to be a review of all present Curator seeding and Critical Path practices in light of my unique experience living as a human for sixty thousand years.  There are no real formal structures of Curator authority, but the Homeless Council has a lot of clout because of its members' experience.  All of the relevant project leaders agreed to let me observe their activities and interview their people.</p>

<p>"Welcome to Complex Life Guidance Station B," the nominal station leader said in greeting.  "Did you know that we also hosted the humans J and M when they were studying to become true Curators?"</p>

<p>"I did not know it was this station," I said.  "It seems like only yesterday I was warning them away from a quarantine world."</p>

<p>"That was you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ironic isn't it.  There are six of us remaining who were recruited to study the humans in their developmental past and still walk among them.  It's gotten hard for the few of us to keep up with everything."</p>

<p>"Well we obviously want to do what we can to prevent anything similar from arising again.  I've been asked to prioritize our mission schedule according to what you'd like to see."</p>

<p>"Well, obviously I don't think Earth was all that different from other worlds before advanced primates showed up, so I'm most interested in worlds that you expect to pass on to the Critical Path teams fairly soon."</p>

<p>"That is what I expected."  He turned to address his navigator.  "As we discussed, let's make way to 49810082 and see how the dinoids there are doing."  He turned to me.  "It will be a good visit to make since it's been about ninety thousand Earth years since our last visit."</p>

<p>"I was hoping to socialize a bit with your crew and get a sense of their skills and motivations," I said.</p>

<p>"Of course.  At any given time most of our crew don't have anything immediate to do, so they will probably be eager to talk to you."</p>

<p>Eager might not have been the correct word, but as I mingled and made it clear that wearing a human bioform was a duty that cost a lot in dignity and self-respect, those who hated humans the most gradually warmed to my presence.  When I added that I had learned a lot of generally unknown dirty little details about the human race some of them started to feel me out.</p>

<p>We spent a month with the dinoids and then went on to a world where the promising species were mammalian, but more similar to Earth marsupials than primates.  None of them had reached the point where a Gift would be appropriate; if they had those would be the affair of the Critical Path teams.  The marsupials did receive a crafted virus which it was thought would improve their chances of random mutation later leading to more complex brain structures.</p>

<p>"Are they really in season all the time?" I was asked at a small private gathering in one of the crew's quarters.  This researcher had hinted about ties to some larger organization.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," I said with a snort.  "I can control it myself of course but most of them can't and it's quite a fiasco at times."</p>

<p>"How did they ever do anything successful?"</p>

<p>"They have a lot of passion and energy, and they aren't stupid.  It's extremely important to remember that last bit.  I nearly got my bioform wiped a few times because I forgot it."</p>

<p>"Seems like that would have been an upgrade."</p>

<p>"But incompatible with my mission, which has turned out to be a bit important."  At that everyone solemnly indicated assent.</p>

<p>It took a few more meetings and introductions before I dared mention the Plasma to one of the group's organizers.</p>

<p>He froze in his tracks.  "Those are the serious people," he said.  "They might destroy your bioform on general principles."</p>

<p>I shrugged.  "I am a Curator on a mission.  So far that mission has been to understand the humans.  And I understand them plenty.  I understand what it is like to stand in a city being burned by bombs dropped from the sky.  I understand what it is to watch people who look like you starve while your belly is full because those people don't look <em>quite enough</em> like you.  I understand the mad genius that makes genocide upon its own kind.  And I have heard that the Plasma understand those things too."</p>

<p>"I know where to pass your message," the crewmember said.  "It isn't us you want."</p>

<p><em>That's more true than you know,</em> I thought as I watched him leave.</p>

<p>"We've got a request for you to transfer to Guidance Station C," the project leader told me the next day.  "Apparently they've got some project they particularly want your advice about, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"Sure," I said, and I accepted the coordinates and folded over.</p>

<p>My initial greeting at station C wasn't much different than it had been at B, with a friendly welcome and tour of the station.  Because the stations had been carved from different asteroids at different times they were significantly different.  Station C also had a different vibe.  The B crew had mostly been informal when not working.  The C crew seemed to observe lines of hierarchy, although they were very muted compared to the social structures humans created.  Every interaction seemed to have a dominant or guiding participant, and while there was disagreement and argument there was always a sense of deference in the air.  I made sure to observe it myself so as to fit in.</p>

<p>On station B everyone had a clear role in the station's stated mission which they were eager to talk about.  On C there were ten or fifteen individuals who just seemed to be there, who had no particular expertise or job to do, and who always seemed to take the dominant role in conversations.  I made a habit of running into them as often as possible.  After a few weeks one of them invited me to his room for a private conversation.</p>

<p>"The station B project leader told us that you know of the Plasma," he said very seriously.  "There are some here who are very curious how you found out about them."</p>

<p>"Remarks I heard in passing," I said.  "I don't remember exactly who, but they didn't realize they were being overheard.  They said the Plasma were trying to keep the human disease from spreading.  That sounded like a worthy goal."</p>

<p>"Some of us worry that your thought processes might be contaminated by your bioform.  It is after all a human brain doing your thinking at the moment."</p>

<p>"Fortunately I can recognize the differences between this bioform and my previous hosts.  It requires some effort and constant watchfulness but I have learned how to prevent myself from becoming like the rest of them."</p>

<p>"That is welcome news.  They said you thought your experience might help us in our mission."</p>

<p>"I have seen what they are capable of," I said with a note of passion.  "You know only what they have done in your garden that is ahistoric and disagreeable.  I have lived among them for their entire ascent on the Critical Path.  However bad you think they are I can tell you they are almost certainly ten times worse, and I can tell you <em>how</em>."</p>

<p>"We take our role as Curators very seriously.  There is a plan at work which even not many Curators outside of a small circle understand in full, and we have held to that plan for aeons.  Station B is where we tend to send those individuals we feel aren't fully devoted to the plan.  We usually leave people there or on the geoengineering team until we are sure of their fervor.  To be here you must understand and be willing to do whatever is necessary to further our plan and preserve our garden."</p>

<p>"I have heard you speak of the humans as a disease.  This is factually correct.  They overran their world and destroyed each other by the billions, only avoiding extinction because they are <em>too virulent</em>.  They are a disease, but you don't appreciate what <em>kind</em> of disease they are, because you have eradicated those diseases in your garden.  Most diseases evolve toward a life cycle which requires them not to quickly kill their hosts, but humans are like a hemorragic fever that liquefies all of your organs within a matter of hours, even though there is no reliable path for them to propagate beyond that dead host."</p>

<p>"What do you think should be done about them?"</p>

<p>"Whatever is possible.  They had barely invented their fold drive before they figured out how to defend their worlds against it.  This is the thing, they are violent and short-sighted but they are also smart and talented.  It will be <em>hard</em> to wipe them out."</p>

<p>"But you are willing to help us do that?"</p>

<p>"I cannot move beyond this bioform until the need for it is eradicated."</p>

<p>"There are others you need to talk to," he said.  "I will make arrangements."</p>

<p>New people arrived on the ship.  I came to realize that the leaders I had identified were basically political officers whose job was to further the plan, but I soon realized that the people arriving now were the people who <em>made</em> the plan.  <em>Everybody</em> was deferent to them, and after a few days I was invited to a meeting.  There was no skulking around in the crew cabins for this; I was introduced in a conference room with over fifty people in attendance.</p>

<p>"How do you think you can help us?" one of the new leaders asked me.</p>

<p>"As far as I know there are only eight human bioform Curators," I said.  "Two of them are Jay and Emma, recruited as adults with blank implants and therefore essentially human.  The other six of us were mature Curators who acquired infant human hosts before human civilization began to rise, and we have seen exactly what this species will do if left unchecked.  It is far more horrible than you realize."</p>

<p>"That they are horrible does not bother us," he said.  "It is that they seem poised to expand without limit."</p>

<p>"That is exactly so," I said.  "And in the process of expanding they will destroy everything that stands in their way.  Even each other.  And they are dangerously quick to pick up technology.  They went in one generation -- one <em>short</em> pre-boost generation -- from not having flight to flying chemical rockets to their moon and girdling their world with satellites.  They went in short years after that from not having the fold to having <em>effective defenses</em> against fold-based weapons, and fold-based weapons of their own better than any we have.  Because they <em>love</em> weapons."</p>

<p>"Right now they are using their own nanites, which lack our nanites' engineered limitations, to terraform all manner of completely unsuitable worlds.  They are poised to expand throughout another galaxy larger than this one, occupying far more worlds than we ever have in the process.  They have no respect for deep time or history.  And they will not slow down or stop unless something forces them.  They have acquired the longevity Cure and are applying it to everyone, without requiring them to become sterile first.  They are making primitive fold implants and laying plans to outfit every one of themselves with <em>those</em>.  You cannot reason with them.  You can only destroy them before they destroy you.  This is, in fact, a lesson you have to learn <em>as a human</em> about <em>other humans</em> if you want to live among them very long."</p>

<p>"There are many who would say the problem is solved because they have sent most of their population to another galaxy."</p>

<p>"Those who say that are fools.  The humans will expand exponentially unless they are stopped <em>now</em>.  And I'm not sure it isn't already too late."</p>

<p>Another individual stood up in the middle of the crowd.  "This is what we have also decided," she said.  "We can use your experience to our advantage.  Welcome to the Plasma."</p>

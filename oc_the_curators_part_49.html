<p>It did not really hit me just how old CI:172200 was until the morning, when I happened to notice the little Galactic Common plaque dating the building we were staying in.  It was over five hundred thousand years old, and had been continuously operated as a way station for travelers and visitors for all that time.  The natives did not have the deep longevity Cure which the Witnesses had given M and me, but they did have the same generic boost that all races got if they asked for it, and that meant most of the passerby and help we met were several hundred years old.</p>

<p>On our first full day there our Curator friend gave us a tour of the city.  Unlike many of the world's cities it was above the maximum flood line as the sea level shifted, so it had never been drowned or abandoned, but it also got very cold and more thinly populated during eras when it was high above sea level.  There were monuments to all these eras all over, sometimes standing in the open and sometimes embedded in working buildings.  The oldest building in the city was over five million years old, and this was not a particularly old city for this world.</p>

<p>"How the hell do they keep such old structures looking so good?" M asked as we ate lunch at a picturesque outdoor cafe.</p>

<p>"Nanites," he said.  "There are rejuvenation protocols for floors and walls.  The worn nanites are scrubbed and new ones installed to recreate the original surface profile.  They had this tech from their beginning, over half a billion years ago, so as long as it isn't under salt water or melted by lava they can keep it looking new.  Nanites weren't just a trap we set to keep our children down, you know.  They actually work very well for some things."</p>

<p>"I guess we are a little too close to the space travel thing to appreciate that," I said.</p>

<p>"The vast majority of our children will never travel between the stars.  Or at least that is what we have always believed.  Star travel is important so that our children can exchange skills and ideas, but until recently we never believed that it was a thing all of our children down to the last individual might have a reason to experience."</p>

<p>We retired for our second night on CI:172200 after walking a few miles through the city and never leaving it.</p>

<p>And in the middle of the night, I got up, and feeling a bit dizzy and weird I went outside where I found M lounging on the public balcony off our floor of the hotel.</p>

<p>"Earth," she said, pointing upward.  Something clicked in my head and I felt the rightness of this.  "Hyacinth," she said, and swung her arm down to point through the floor.  Of course space existed in a full sphere even though there was a planet beneath us; that was inconsequential.</p>

<p>"Our ship," I said, and without thinking swung around to point my own finger at a seemingly random spot of sky above.</p>

<p>"I didn't think of thinking of fold ships.  The <em>Surprise</em>..."  I got a sense of a menu being fleshed out of all the ships that might have that name, and an automatic selection being made.  The Promethean <em>Surprise</em> was in orbit, and we could sense its motion.</p>

<p>"Okay," I said.</p>

<p>"What you mean is, 'what the actual fuck.'"</p>

<p>"Yeah, that too."</p>

<p>"It doesn't work for Prometheus though."</p>

<p>"That's because the name 'Prometheus' was never registered through the microfold network.  If you think of it as CI:829166, you will get a bearing," our Curator said as he stepped out of the shadows.</p>

<p>As soon as he gave us the index M and I both swung our arms around in the same direction, which of course was the same point at which I'd located the <em>Implausible Alibi</em>, which we'd left parked on Prometheus.</p>

<p>"What the fuck have you done to us?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I have lived a very long time," he said with a wry smile.  "And when you live as long as I have, there are certain memories you cherish.  One of mine is our first encounter on the quarantine world.  When I folded away and you, M, dove for the place I had just been standing, I knew you were both a species and a pair of individuals that we should recruit.  You have no idea how many of our children would have just shrugged and said 'fuck it' before obediently running home.  But there were strong forces on my side opposing human recruitment because of your lack of Curation, and all the reasons we hadn't Curated you, and general worry about what humans might do with the unrestrained powers we offer."</p>

<p>"Obviously you overcame that," M said dryly.</p>

<p>"You proved your worth at Prometheus," he said.  "You didn't just Curate successfully, you finished a Curation that we couldn't.  Even those who find you suspect can't ignore that."</p>

<p>"You set it up," I said.  "You sent us to the Witnesses, and we became exiles because of their longevity treatment.  So we had nothing else to do but go to Prometheus."</p>

<p>"I might have had something to do with that," he admitted.  "It didn't take much of a push to get the Witnesses to practice their art on you; that's why I sent you to them instead of to those who do similar work for us."</p>

<p>To my surprise I saw tears running down M's cheeks.  "I have missed Earth so much," she said.  "I can't believe you did that to us."</p>

<p>"Can I make it up to you?  Would you like to visit Earth now?"</p>

<p>"How would that be possible now when it wasn't last week?"</p>

<p>"You have fold implants now.  You don't know how to use them yet but while you are novices I can control them for you, and they will do most of the work of protecting you without even any intervention.  Even with the amplifier I can't really protect two other people the way personal implants can."</p>

<p>"Take us," M said.</p>

<p>A moment later we stepped out from behind one of the service structures onto the roadbed of the Golden Gate Bridge.  There were hundreds of people around.  It was a clear day and we could see Alcatraz, Angel Island, and even Oakland.  There was no vehicular traffic and the entire deck was occupied by walkers, joggers, and bicyclists.  A large sign just above our arrival point reminded everyone that powered vehicles were forbidden.</p>

<p>It smelled like Earth.  After forty years both the scent of the atmosphere and one Earth gravity settled in our bones like familiar old friends.</p>

<p>"So how is this safe now when it wasn't before?" M asked.</p>

<p>"There are defensive measures your implants can take that mine can't do for you."</p>

<p>"Defensive measures against what?"</p>

<p>"Anything, really."</p>

<p>"So what happens if someone shoots one of us?"</p>

<p>"Good example.  Your implant will fold you to safety without conscious direction.  Mine can't do that for you."</p>

<p>"Where the fuck is this implant anyway?" M asked.  "Where's the black spot on our medical scans?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there isn't one," the Curator said with a smile.  "Your implants exist in a folded hypersphere of matter-compatible space almost completely separate from our own universe.  They only exist in our universe at the points where they interact with your nervous system."</p>

<p>"That doesn't sound too reliable."</p>

<p>"We've been doing it for almost eight billion years.  In the early going there was an effort to develop something more ... native to the higher dimensions, but those projects weren't as reliable as normal matter in a stabilized fold bubble.  So to this day we build the implants here in the Milky Way, and the first thing they do when powered up is fold themselves off into bubbles."</p>

<p>"You build them here out of normal matter?  What are they like in that form?"</p>

<p>"About thirty meters in diameter.  Not of nanites, obviously, but built with the same techniques we used to make the original nanites.  They are over a hundred times denser and faster than human assembly solutions.  Each of your implants is far more powerful than any computer or even full network ever deployed in natural space."</p>

<p>"My sense of position seems to be getting sharper by the minute," M said.</p>

<p>"It will do that.  Eventually it will know your neurome well enough to immerse you in photo-realistic alternate reality if it has a reason.  At this early stage you are probably seeing wire-frame diagrams and number dumps."</p>

<p>"Check," I said.  "So what about the amplifier belts?"</p>

<p>"Same technology, different scale.  Those are almost a kilometer in diameter as natural matter before they leave the universe.  Needless to say we can't make a lot of those, and they are incredibly dangerous in the wrong hands.  Your implants create a standardized control interface so the amplifiers don't have to know your neurome.  Would you two care for a drink?"</p>

<p>"I think we're going to need one," M said.</p>

<p>We faded back behind the stantion where we had appeared and a moment later we emerged from the rest room corridor at the Top of the Mark.  The hostess seated us and we scanned the martini menu.  Like the gravity, it was like homecoming to experience the simple ordinary geometry and workmanship of a human building made by the techniques we remembered, sheetrock and carpet and hardwood and honest simple paint.</p>

<p>There were dozens of fold ships in orbit and at rest on the ground.  We could sense all of them, and identify the alien ones that were properly registered.</p>

<p>"I don't understand how we can become Curators," M said.  "We aren't your species."</p>

<p>The Curator looked down at the floor for a moment.  "The original race of Curators who made us all has been long extinct," he said.  "They died along with their homeworld when it became uninhabitable because of their star's evolution.  There were many of them out in the galaxy doing our work but those individuals had all taken the longevity Cure and had accepted sterility as a necessary condition.  Back then -- even now, really except for you humans -- it had not occurred to anybody to try anything like a mass interstellar emigration to establish a new home.  Our ancestors thought it would be a better use of those worlds they had Curated to see what evolution might create."</p>

<p>"Then who are you?"</p>

<p>"Most of us alive today were recruited, as I just recruited you, although usually with less drama.  It is also common for us to be serially immortal.  After a certain period, usually a few thousand years, your implant will know your neurome well enough to fully emulate it.  At that point it can separate from this bioform and interface with a suitably young individual of another species, and gradually impress your personality on its neurome.  We usually choose infant children who would have died for some unrelated reason for this purpose.  And of course we can adjust the imprints which are carried over to make sure there is fulfillment rather than disgust with the new bioform even if it is quite different.  I have only been human for about sixty thousand Earth years, but I am about thirty million years old.  I have changed species dozens of times as my assignment has shifted.  And I am actually young for a Curator."</p>

<p>"Who gives out these assignments?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Obviously we have a structure of government, although it is hard to explain without going into some fairly deep math.  Most of us are recruited with an expectation that we will give some measure of service, but by our choice there is no enforcement mechanism for this.  In your case we don't even have an expectation of service; we want to see what you make of and do with your new powers.  We have pointed you in the general direction of a couple of problems we'd be interested in seeing you tackle, but if you decide to retire and spend eternity living in virtual reality instead, you'll find you have quite a bit of company and nobody will stop you."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't call in the mortgage on your supercomputer implants?"</p>

<p>"Nobody would ever accept one if we did that sort of thing.  That's a risk for us, which is one reason I had to arrange for you to prove yourselves in order to get your recruitment approved."</p>

<p>M finally took a sip, and then a deep swig of her world-famous Top of the Mark martini.  "You say our implants will fold us away from danger," she said.  "Is there a way to maybe make them do something more ... theatrical?"</p>

<p>"Once you are in control you'll find they are fully programmable, and far more powerful than any computer you've ever imagined.  The tools for that are very high-level, and will tune themselves to your neurome as you use them."</p>

<p>"How long does it usually take to get to that point of control?  To not be ... novices?"</p>

<p>"It usually takes a couple of years.  But you are progressing very fast.  As your novitial mentor, I get reports.  That's how I knew you were out here testing your new fold senses.  Your aptitude may have a lot to do with the human imagination.  Even while sitting here you are constantly thinking of situations, hypotheticals, and evaluating potential answers.  This is the thing I saw on the quarantine world.  Where nearly any other species watching me disappear would have simply thrown up their hands and said 'whatever,' you wanted to know what I had done.  You wanted to be able to do it yourselves.  And you wanted it <em>badly</em>.  This hunger is making it easy for your implants to figure out the relationships within your neurome.  You will probably be out of novice mode in a few months, but I wouldn't advise entering dangerous situations until you've gotten a bit more experience beyond that point."</p>

<p>M finished her martini and signaled for another.  "If we are going to fix the political situation here we need to make a splash," she said.  "J, do you think our friends at the Witness textilery can manage spandex?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure they will figure it out," I said, seeing where she was going with this.</p>

<p>The Curator smiled.  "I am almost afraid of what I have started here.  And that is wonderful."</p>

<p>"Did you find Helen?"</p>

<p>"No, and I didn't find out what whoever is there is actually doing."</p>

<p>"Can't you read implant ID's now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I wasn't able to read Helen's when she was still here."</p>

<p>"Oh, right."  Veronica reached for a pad and typed out a sixteen digit number.</p>

<p>"That's the right format, but how would you know it?"</p>

<p>"It used to be my implant."</p>

<p>"But I didn't know my own implant's ID until I got the rover access code that let me read it."</p>

<p>"It's usually kept below the level of conscious awareness but it's actually one of the first engrams a new implant will synchronize so that it can positively identify its current bioform host.  When I gave up the implant its ID came to my conscious awareness so that I could link back up with it if possible.  I had to consciously avoid luring it back to me so you could give it to Helen."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a thing," I said as I committed the number to memory.  "There are over ten thousand Curators in that settlement plus a less certain number of non-Curator support personnel.  And being human I don't dare show myself to anyone."</p>

<p>"Of course.  Thus Helen's advantage."  Veronica made her way to an end table and opened a drawer.  "You might find these useful," she said.</p>

<p>The box contained half a dozen dull gray marble-sized spheres.  "What are they?"</p>

<p>"Drones.  The agency made them for me when I still had the implant.  Good quality audio and video relays, microfold comms, supergravity propulsion.  Designed to be controlled by either a Curator or human manufactured implant.  They can't fold.  These are keyed to my old implant but they can be recoded for yours.  When you return, don't even go to the city.  Set up camp somewhere inconspicuous and send these."</p>

<p>"What's their control range?"</p>

<p>"Well you can't pilot them from <em>here</em>," she laughed.  "But for the microfold, a hundred klicks away is as good as next door.  They're not running an inhibitor?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then they're either amateurs or supremely confident in their position."</p>

<p>"Those two things are not inconsistent with one another."</p>

<p>"No.  We do know the Curators are terrible at security.  They're just too confident in their own superiority to be sufficiently paranoid.  You wouldn't <em>believe</em> some of the things I've seen among our exile population.  Not having an implant hasn't even really been a handicap when dealing with them."</p>

<p>We made a side trip by aircar to Atlanta to meet Veronica's current supervisors, who agreed to recode her drones to respond to me and to show me how to operate them. </p>

<p>"Their vision is unidirectional, so you can't see what's behind them unless you fly a formation, which is of course riskier for notice than a single unit."</p>

<p>"Thank you," I said.</p>

<p>"Use them well.  Our agent has told us how important this could be, and it's not a sacrifice on our part when we no longer have an implanted agent who can control them.  Thank you for being a friend to Earth and to the human race."</p>

<p>I picked up some lightweight camping gear which was within my interstellar fold payload limit and made my way back to Gateway and then the mystery base.</p>

<hr />

<p>I did not begin by taking Veronica's advice.  Instead I folded to a natural area on the near outskirts of the base city and launched one of the drones.  As it looked down from a safe height I sent an addressed ping for the implant ID Veronica had given me, and got a solid reply.</p>

<p>I sent the drone to investigate.</p>

<p>The location estimate centered on a cluster of modest dwellings.  The Curators don't tend to go in for structures like dormitory blocks, so this looked like the kind of housing a new recruit might be afforded.  I spied from a safe height during the day and floated down to spy through the windows at night.  It took me two days to get lucky but I found her; if she was leaving her cabin, it was by fold and not foot.  But I spotted her briefly through a window and now I knew where she lived.</p>

<p>I retrieved the drone, folded out to a more remote area and pitched my tent.</p>

<p>Before I confronted Helen I wanted to know as much as I could about what was going on.  The industrial buildings were windowless and therefore a challenge.  I could of course sense their interior contents to a certain extent, especially if I located myself closer to the city, but I couldn't tell what was being stored within them or exactly what the workers, most of whom weren't implanted Curators, were doing inside.  </p>

<p>After about a week I sent a drone and slipped it into the pocket of a worker who was reporting for work.  This was extremely risky but I was out of ideas.  Once the worker was inside the building I slipped the drone out of the pocket and scurried for a dark corner.  Fortunately nobody noticed it.  They were all busy donning clean room suits, and checking in through another door.</p>

<p>Clean room suits?</p>

<p>I slipped the drone in through the next layer of security and found a huge room dominated by a lattice of what looked kind of like glass storage cubicles.  The workers were chatting in various dialects of Galactic Common, and I listened in.</p>

<p>"The feedback stabilization on 1227 seems to be off."
"One of the gravity plates isn't to spec."
"We can't let it affect the ones around it."
"Assembly 1227 is only fifteen percent complete anyway, we can sacrifice it."
"Adjust the completion schedule though."</p>

<p>Eventually most of the workers left and I risked flying the drone closer, avoiding open spaces as much as possible.  The lattice was made of cubes a bit less than a meter on edge, and there were thousands of them.  I did a quick orbit of the room and calculated that there were nearly ten thousand in this room, which was just a small portion of the building.  And each cube seemed to contain a sphere of varying size suspended by some invisible force.</p>

<p><em>gravity plates?</em></p>

<p>As the drone watched filament-like tendrils brushed the spheres in a complex dance.  A dance of creation, I realized.  These were nanoassembly stations, each kept isolated from both gravity and vibration by a gravity plate suspension system.</p>

<p>I heard the workers coming back and quickly flew the drone to what I hoped was a safe corner.  I snuck it out the same way I had snuck it in and made a careful analysis of the video I'd recorded.</p>

<hr />

<p>After a few more investigatory runs I folded into Helen's residence while she was away.  She nodded politely when she folded in and saw that I was waiting for her.</p>

<p>"Very impressive," she said.  "You shouldn't be here though."</p>

<p>"Do you happen to know what they're doing in the big square building?"</p>

<p>"Need to know basis, but I suspect that's where they're building the planet killers."</p>

<p>"So this is a Plasma base."</p>

<p>"This place <em>is</em> the Plasma.  Arriving Curators are scanned for the fold following worm before they're allowed near the city, and once they come here they almost never leave.  They believe they are safe here."</p>

<p>I held up my hand and showed her what was going on inside the new manufactory.  "About what I thought," she said.  "Veronica must have given you her drones."</p>

<p>"I'm surprised you didn't take them."</p>

<p>"She offered, but I didn't dare risk smuggling anything like that here.  I'm not sure what they can or can't sense foldwise."</p>

<p>"While we both have the benefit of your Ancestor's knowledge, he didn't have the benefit of having a fold equipped implant for a few million years.  I know very exactly what they can and can't do, and they have no idea what we can do.  Even though your Ancestor didn't have any experience with fold tech, his knowledge of the secret keys gives you a lot of abilities the rest of these guys lack."</p>

<p>"Yes, such as..."  I was alerted that something was probing my implant's controls.  Then her eyes widened.  "You disabled the level zero pass code?"</p>

<p>"I had some help."</p>

<p>She looked puzzled.  "Who could have possibly..."  then her eyes widened again.  "The <em>rover?</em>  It's still active?"</p>

<p>"Helping with a terraforming project at the Pinwheel," I said.  "And such other matters as we might bring to it.  It likes to have useful things to do."</p>

<p>"Well that's good, because I don't have to immunize you from what I'm doing here.  But you need to leave.  If you stay you will likely lose your bioform, and I know you like being human."</p>

<p>"I find it interesting that you knew they were building planet killers."</p>

<p>"There's no point being here if you don't know they're building planet killers."</p>

<p>"And what is your role, in their estimation?"</p>

<p>She sighed and closed her eyes for a moment.  "Oh, I'm an important cog for their plan.  They were visibly delighted to have a Promethean recruit.  The new design can fold navigate and even navigate intergalactically, but not with much accuracy or intelligence.  My role is to smuggle one directly to Deucalion and make certain that it takes out the Promethean colony there.  The Plasma have elected to spare the Promethean population and world here, but they regard those who left the galaxy as traitors who must be eliminated."</p>

<p>"So you know how to deploy one of their new murder balls?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  Once triggered they will try to fold the nearest world into its star, and if that fails because of a span limiter they will station at an appropriate distance and try to form a solar bomb.  Manual trigger requires a code which will be specific to the device, but they will also trigger on the same sequence as the prototype that attacked Terminus, vacuum followed by fold followed by nearby world and sun."</p>

<p>"Versatile.  They do realize that humans are in four other galaxies now?"</p>

<p>"They believe they can manufacture faster than we can settle new worlds to self-sustaining population densities."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure <em>all</em> of them are here?  We already just pissed them off once and look what they're up to."</p>

<p>"Very sure.  They've had a thousand Earth years to gather and hide from the chaos you caused.  They believe they have isolated this place from the fold following plague and it's the one place where the uninfected who know of it feel safe."</p>

<p>"And what about all the implant deficient help?"</p>

<p>"Chosen for their manufacturing related skills, and preferred because they cannot serve as vectors for the fold following worm.  Some of them have been given the mortality Cure.  They've been told that they will be given implants once the primary task is handled and the manufacturing is online."</p>

<p>"Do they know that a Curator implant is the size of a small building, and that these assembly pods are little on the small side to make one?"</p>

<p>She snickered.  "Someone might have forgotten to mention that to them."</p>

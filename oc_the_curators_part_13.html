<p>The raiders' fur was decorated in a dazzling mix of colors and patterns, and it took a moment for me to realize these were artificial, not natural.  The raiders were bipedal, with hands much like our own but oddly cloven feet which were thickly shielded from the ground by some kind of horn or nail shield, and they wore their Mark of the Curators across what a human would call his chest.  The colorful patterns carefully avoided the Mark.  It was not clear how their weapons worked; they appeared heavy and had roughly the shape of a long gun, but whatever they were it was clear from the way they handled the devices that they could make something bad happen if pointed at you.</p>

<p>I gestured toward the <em>Boxcar</em> and said, "This is our first gift.  We give you this starship.  It is an example of our craft for you to either use or take apart and inspect as you desire.  We place no constraints on this gift."</p>

<p>"Not that you could."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"What do you want in return?"</p>

<p>"We would like to make a proposal to your leaders.  This is just the beginning of what we hope might be a long term partnership."</p>

<p>They took us to a place that looked a lot like a hotel, except for the really secure doors and lack of windows.  And we were there for awhile.  They gave us water and eventually food which was obviously nanite duplication of template stuff we had left behind on the <em>Boxcar</em>, and otherwise we had no communication of any kind with anybody.  M worried about that, but I told her they were probably picking the <em>Boxcar</em> apart before deciding whether we were worth an interview.  Finally we were summoned.</p>

<p>There were about thirty raiders physically in the room but the real leaders appeared by video.  "Your perverse modesty habits give us worry that you might be hiding weapons," the leading physically present raider said with a shrug.</p>

<p>"And we have also been told that you have no Mark of the Curators," one of the leaders said from a large projection screen.  "We find this highly unbelievable."</p>

<p>I started to unbutton my shirt but M slapped my hands away.  "No J, I got this," she said, and she disrobed, casually tossing her clothes to the corners of the room as if she didn't care if she ever retrieved them.  "It's appropriate," she said as she cast off her shirt.  "After all I was also naked when I destroyed their ship."</p>

<p>I sucked in my breath, but the aliens didn't react.</p>

<p>"We are more relaxed in our perverse modesty habit when we sleep," she continued.  Pants to the other side of the room.</p>

<p>"Our ship <em>scree</em> caught you sleeping?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  It was an excellently planned attack," she said as she flung her panties away.</p>

<p>"How did you ever prevail?"</p>

<p>"I had programmed my ship to monitor for unexpected fold activity.  It woke me up when yours entered the system."</p>

<p>"Your ship can monitor for fold activity without active human operators?"</p>

<p>"Our ships can <em>fold</em> without human operators.  But in this case all it had to do was get me and J awake and to it before your guys bombed our tent."  She let this sink in -- as with the Vikings, victory is victory but killing your enemy as they sleep is not exactly glorious.  M, now naked, held her hands up and slowly spun around so they could see her from every angle.</p>

<p>"Extraordinary," several voices said from the projectors.  And then one:  "But you are marked.  If not the Curators, how did that happen?"</p>

<p>M displayed her tattoos.  "As with everything else, the Curators were useless to us so we have to mark ourselves.  We do it by injecting ink into the skin.  It's painful but that's part of the meaning.  This one is the first combat group I flew with.  This one celebrates becoming a test pilot, flying things which might not work as we expect so we can fix them if they don't kill us first.  And this one is my first combat kill.  It's been awhile since we had a hot war on Earth so that's your ship."</p>

<p>I was not sure this provocation was a good idea, but M is a warrior and her instincts proved true.  "It is good that our warriors are remembered," one of the video leaders said.</p>

<p>"So let us hear from your companion, warrior," one of the others said.</p>

<p>M motioned for me to stand back again.  "I am a warrior, but J is a diplomat.  I trained to kill.  He trained to heal, and found himself mixed up in this galactic business.  Please don't think of him as a weak person because he hasn't killed a fold ship.  In the important ways, the ways that matter most to both of our species, he is stronger than me."  And then she waved me on.</p>

<p>"We give you the ship <em>Boxcar</em> which we used to establish our own first beachhead on an undeveloped world.  Inside it you will find all the tools and technical manuals necessary to disassemble and maintain it, and samples of the fluids necessary to service and fuel it; your nanites should be able to duplicate you an adequate supply of them.  You are welcome to use the ship as it is as we did or pick it apart for its technology.  We will answer any technical questions you have for us.  Our intention is to keep no secrets of our technology from you."</p>

<p>"The <em>reason</em> we make this offer is that we want you to understand how difficult it would be for you to switch from your established nanite technology to our methods.  Our engines and our tiny fold drives are built on generations of work by hundreds of thousands of people, building tools that were used to build tools that were needed to build more tools.  Unlike yourselves, we had no nanites so there were many intermediate products we needed which justified this technology as we built it up.  There are vast complexes staffed by thousands of humans dedicated to making various small parts of the <em>Boxcar</em>.  We think you would find it hard to justify duplicating all that work just to make small fold ships.  We could be wrong, in which case we will give you all the help we can.  But even with an all out effort by your entire species it would be decades before you are able to make these things without our help."</p>

<p>"But we did not come here to discourage you.  We came to offer you the same ability that we have, to independently create colonies for your people on the undeveloped Curated worlds of the galaxy, which greatly outnumber those that have developed.  Since your fold ships are too large to land, you need to keep them in orbit if you're not doing a quick raid, and your bottleneck is that you need ground infrastructure to generate power for ground to orbit shuttles.  That infrastructure, like the fold ships, is too large to transport to the surface of another world.  So you can get there but getting back is not practical."</p>

<p>I reached into my pocket and pulled out a small projector.  "If I may," I said.  The physically present raiders stiffened but they didn't interfere.  I turned it on and projected a picture onto the wall behind me.  There were murmurs.  I knew this basic Earth consumer tech was far smaller than anything they could make.</p>

<p>"Your power generation technique is clean and elegant, using the fold drive to recycle falling objects past magnetic coils.  But it's not very energy dense, so you need a lot of towers.  Nanites make such construction practical, but not fast, and the nanites themselves need power to do the construction.  These are portable power generating devices that work on a different principle.  This station is based on two structures we call shipping containers.  They are designed to be transported, and can be parachuted to the surface of a world from a fold ship.  They work by using your microfold communication technology to tap energy from the interior of a star, using it to boil water to drive a turbine-driven generator.  You are watching a team of six humans assemble these two units into a station that will generate enough power to return a shuttle to orbit in a few days.  It will take them four days to get everything hooked up and working."</p>

<p>I let this settle in.</p>

<p>"Unlike the fold drive, this is a technology that is within your immediate reach with nanite tech and tools and parts easily built with nanite tech.  We have generations of experience with these steam generators which we will share with you.  And while we used the same microfold sunlight power to destroy your ship, this was our first application for the solar microfold.  It was the power generator that gave us the idea for the sunlight cannon."</p>

<p>"So you will be giving us your superweapon too," one of the leaders said from a monitor.</p>

<p>"You don't even need us for that.  The only secret of the sunlight cannon is that it is possible to make them at all.  Making boilers and generators can be a bit tricky though, and we can steer you past a lot of mistakes we made learning those crafts."</p>

<p>From another monitor, "This is an extraordinary offer which seems much more likely to be some kind of trick than to be genuine."</p>

<p>"These are extraordinary times.  We reason that if you are busy expanding your culture to new worlds, you will have no need to make war with us on the other side of the galaxy, or even your old neighbors.  We have this experience with members of our own species who sometimes became raiders.  Buying them off did not work, but accepting them as neighbors and working together with them in partnership did.  Within a few generations nobody remembered that our ancestors had once been bitter enemies."</p>

<p>"You have the ship.  We make this further offer:  We will give you the location of Earth.  We have brought the segments of a docking ring which will make it possible for our shuttle to dock with you; mount it to one of your fold ships and send it to Earth.  All we ask is that you make stable orbit.  We will provide shuttle service for any personnel you wish to send, and we will show them anything they want to see -- our production facilities, our transportation infrastructure, our power plants, even our weapons.  And we will give them the power generation technology, which was a bit too big to fit in the <em>Boxcar</em>."</p>

<p>I offered the projector to one of the physically present raiders who seemed to be in charge, and they escorted us back to our room.  M did not bother to retrieve her clothing, but it was delivered to us in a leather bag a couple of hours later.</p>

<p>We were locked in our suite and had no communications with the outside world, but they treated us decently.  After two days a screen lit up and one of the raider leaders addressed us.  "We have decided to accept your offer to visit Earth.  The fold ship <em>scree</em> has just departed with your docking ring in place."</p>

<p>"We were kind of hoping to go with it," I said.</p>

<p>"You should hope this goes well," the raider said.  "Whether you ever see your world again depends on the reception we receive from your people."</p>

<p>"Well that's not ominous at all," I said as the screen went dark.</p>

<p>"And not exactly unexpected, either.  Vikings, remember?" M said.  "Just be glad we're not in chains in a dungeon.  Yet."</p>

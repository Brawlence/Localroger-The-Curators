<p>Although K wouldn't take my calls after our last meeting, I got along well with the director of the Sevillian nanite lab who took it upon itself to give me a thorough overview of its craft while I waited for the foldship to make its scheduled return to Earth.</p>

<p>It turns out there are over a hundred types of nanite, including several which aren't intended to become part of a final structure.  Orchestrating the dance of nanites to build a macroscopic structure, particularly a large one like a building, is a feat on the order of any kind of engineering humans have ever done.  The one thing that is constant about nanites is their 400 nanometer edgewise cubical structure.  It is that standard that makes the whole thing flow.</p>

<p>Along the way I took pictures of all the electron micrograph posters, and even went on a couple of field trips to see and take phone video of the construction process.  A couple of days before departure I finally dared ask about the fold drive, and found my circumspection on the topic had been unnecessary.  My host proudly told me there were four species of nanites that had no other purpose than to make critical parts of the fold generators, and while they knew the math and they knew the operating principle they didn't really have a way to make that kind of hardware without using the original nanites which had been given to them by the Curators.  </p>

<p>Finally, over glasses of another stupidly expensive Earth brandy, I said I was curious about how the Curators intervene.  The Sevillian I had fallen into the habit of calling L said that if I wanted to observe Curator activity, I really needed to find a world on the "предельная стезя" between the introduction of agriculture and writing and the final maturation of space travel and the fold drive.  "That is the interval when the Curators are most active in a species' development," it said.  "It's a very clear thing from the archaeological record."</p>

<p>"Most active in <em>most</em> race's development," I kind of scowled.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, our friend K told me.  I have no explanation and hope you find one that is satisfactory."  It turned out the Sevillians were aware of several such current предельная стезя races, but there was no fold ship service to their worlds because the Curators enforced a quarantine.</p>

<p>Later, on Earth, the Director of our foldship project and several of his top aides listened intently to my account of all of this.  They solemnly copied the photos off my phone and didn't even warn me about showing them around or talking about what had happened.  "We really appreciate what you are doing," he said.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure what I <em>am</em> doing."</p>

<p>"I think you might be becoming our first ambassador to the galaxy."</p>

<p>Later, on what I thought at first was a random walk through the facility, we came to a large machine.  "We are pretty sure this would solve our largest problem," he said.  "It is a fold suppressor.  The Universe doesn't actually like folds to come in contact, and it can be stopped.  The math is sound and we're pretty sure it can't be overcome.  The problem is it would also take us out of the interstellar community if we deployed it."</p>

<p>"Foldships could always slow down and come close by some other method."</p>

<p>"They really have no other method.  Their foldships are so large they have no other practical drive than the fold generator itself, and if we disable that they would be helpless as they crashed in our gravity well.  None of them would ever risk coming near such a thing."</p>

<p>"I might still feel safer with this thing running if our own people start making fold drives."</p>

<p>"Exactly, which is why we built and tested it.  But we think something better is possible."  We walked some more and came to a cavernous space being prepped for construction.  "This is where we are going to build the fold span limiter."</p>

<p>I didn't want to sound stupid, so I just looked inquisitive.</p>

<p>The Director smiled.  "The extent of the fold field in three-dimensional space is mostly determined by the mass surrounding the original fold point.  It establishes a resonance in ten-dimensional space which fixes the size of the fold.  Given a mostly solid spherical mass surrounding the fold point, the usual dimension is about three times the radius of the physical mass."</p>

<p>"So that's why if you fold off of the planet you take the whole planet with you?"</p>

<p>"It's a bit more complicated.  If you don't know what you're doing you take the whole planet, but even if you know the constants and start at the surface, you take a chunk about the size of a large stadium."</p>

<p>"Still doesn't sound very practical."</p>

<p>"It's not.  The thing is, the same principle that makes it possible to suppress the fold should also make it possible to limit the span of a fold.  We are pretty sure we can make this thing and we are working on it 24/7.  It would let us allow foldships to visit without allowing either our own crazies or anyone else to fold us off into the Sun.  Basically it would only suppress folds that aren't properly configured."</p>

<p>"Sounds like a worthwhile project," I observed neutrally.</p>

<p>"Not our most important though," he said.  We walked some more, finally through a garage door into the outdoors.  We walked up to what I recognized as a two-seat trainer VTOL jump jet.</p>

<p>"Behold mankind's first starship," my host said."</p>

<p>"This thing has a fold drive?  I thought the fold drive itself was bigger than this whole airplane."</p>

<p>"It is, if you make it with nanites.  Our fabrication methods are flat but much finer.  Our fold drive is about half a meter across.  We chose this jet because its pressurization system wasn't hard to enhance for full vacuum.  It can fall into the atmosphere and glide to the ground, then jump and fly high enough to safely fold out of the atmosphere with very little fuel."</p>

<p>"Have you ever flown it?"</p>

<p>"There's someone I want you to meet."  I saw that a woman in uniform was walking toward us.  He made introductions.  "First human ambassador to the stars, meet our first starship pilot."</p>

<p>"I've taken it to every world in the Solar System," she said as we shook hands.  "Let me tell you, Pluto is <em>weird</em>."</p>

<p>I looked at the Director.  "Oh, we've recorded good scientific data, although we'll have to be careful releasing it," he said.  "Within a few years everyone will know about this, but for now it's one of our biggest secrets."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure I am getting used to this," I said with a bit of a morbid chuckle.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's about to get a lot worse.  Your next assignment is to go to one of the предельная стезя worlds the Sevillians told you about and find evidence of Curator activity."</p>

<p>"Which one?"</p>

<p>"I figured I would leave that decision to you."</p>

<p>"I haven't been out of the Solar System yet," my pilot said reassuringly.  "Looking forward to it."</p>

<p>So the very next day I was over a hundred light-years from Earth, this time in a craft made entirely by human industry, with a pilot who was having way too much fun as she folded us in and out of planetary gravity wells to check and match velocities.  Finally we folded into the upper atmosphere of a world that looked a lot like Earth, Seville, or Pompeii.</p>

<p>"We'll be on the ground in about half an hour," M said from the front seat.</p>

<p>"We won't burn up?"</p>

<p>"We don't have orbital velocity.  We'll fall until we can glide, then I'll start the engines to land us."</p>

<p>This all went according to plan until we landed in a clear area and popped the cockpit bubble.  "Aren't we the first humans on this world?" I asked as M took off her pressure mask.</p>

<p>"Of course.  The aliens don't come here, and this is the only human starship."</p>

<p>"Well then how is it that there's a human being standing at the edge of the clearing?"</p>

<p>He gave the appearance of a well-groomed British gentleman and he watched quietly as we stowed our gear and departed the starcraft.  Once we were on the ground he approached and offered his hand, which we each shook cordially.</p>

<p>M deferred to me, as I was supposed to be the ambassador.  "I thought we were the first humans here," I said with an attitude of respect and slight surprise.</p>

<p>«О, это так». — улыбаясь, ответил он. — «Мы отточили искуство ходить в рядах наших детей вечность назад. Приди я в любой ваш самый продвинутый госпиталь, никто и не заподозрили бы во мне пришельца — но, тем не менее, я один из тех, кого вы зовёте Кураторами».</p>

<p>"We came here to find you," I said.</p>

<p>«Знаю. Очевидно, Земля является моим обычным уделом — но, когда мы осознали, что вы собираетесь нарушить карантин, мне было поручено прибыть сюда и остановить вас. Обе расы ваших знакомых по космосу молоды, сами едва только из карантина, и они не понимали — и посему не сообщили —, насколько это опасно».</p>

<p>«Чем же?»</p>

<p>"We do not care much about what happens to species that have not reached the start of the предельная стезя.  They live and die all the time, accomplishing nothing, arousing no interest.  And we consider it a duty of those species that have completed the предельная стезя and gained space travel to learn to deal with the challenges they will find in the vastness of space and myriad interactions of interstellar commerce.  Should you attempt a rampage of conquest they should be able to defend themselves.</p>

<p>"But the species on the предельная стезя are interesting to us but vulnerable to premature influences and not yet able to defend themselves against invaders armed with high technology.  We do not want you to recruit or prosyletize them or impose an order here.  We want these beings to define their own order, refine it, reinforce it, then take it to the galaxy to participate in the просторном саду, что мы создавали на протяжении почти восьми миллиардов ваших Земных лет».</p>

<p>M spoke up.  "You don't seem to have cared much for us on our предельная стезя," she said with a sharp tone of bitterness.</p>

<p>"Your belligerence worried us," the Curator said unfazed.  "You are far more willing to murder your brothers and sisters than is usual.  We decided to develop you slowly so you might have time to mature beyond this impulse, but it happened that every time we thought it was a suitable time for a development, you had either done it already yourselves or were about to.  In the latter cases we allowed you to advance on your own so you could own your achievement.  For all your troubles your species has made remarkable accomplishments.  Even though you made it from a murder weapon your craft here is a wonderfully and uniquely small and maneuverable starship."</p>

<p>"It didn't occur to you to intervene to help us with our belligerence, rather than leave us to our own devices?"</p>

<p>He shrugged.  "It was a judgement call.  Your rate of advancement has been startling.  We underestimated the effect the threat of mutual murder would have even on those of you not inclined so much to fratricide, since you had to defend yourselves against the dangerous minority.  Of course your dangerous ones tend to find high office in your political systems, which is an ongoing problem.  For aeons our policy has been one of mostly nonintervention.  Sometimes our children kill themselves instead of developing; it's a natural part of what we are trying to encourage.  We have had other murderous children, but none so technologically successful as yourselves."</p>

<p>«И теперь, у нас есть свёртыватель».</p>

<p>«Да. Интересно посмотреть, как вы им воспользуетесь. Он настолько же опасен, насколько полезен.  !!!
    "Yes.  It will be interesting to see what you do with it.  It is as dangerous as it is useful.  Only a handful of species in all of our experience have ever gone to the trouble to build nuclear weapons.  The ability to make a big messy poisonous explosion is rather unimpressive next to what a fold drive can do, and most of our children get the fold drive without ever building the massive industrial works you have made."</p>

<p>«И с нанитами, любой желающий индивид может сделать двигатель свёртки».</p>

<p>«Именно».</p>

<p>«И что же нас ждёт?»</p>

<p>«Вы покинете эту планету и не посетите ни одного мира на карантине предельной стези. В основном, мы считаем вас заботой наших детей и вас самих — но мы не потерпим помех в своём садоводстве. В одном севильцы ввели вас в заблуждение потому, что сами правды не знают. Наши стандарты разумны; получив правильные настроечные параметры, никто из наших детей не был настолько глуп, чтобы вывернуть родную планету в недра звезды случайно. Но несколько планет всё же вывернулось в звёзды. Мы не пытаемся создать упорядоченный и строгий сад; мы хотим, чтобы дети наши преподносили нам сюрприз. Ничто не было бы так скучно и бесполезно, как полная галактика спроектированной жизни, соответствующей какому-нибудь идеальному техзаданию. Но даже так, время от времени приходится пропалывать сорняки».</p>

<p>«Это угроза?» — резко спросила М.</p>

<p>«Просто предупреждение. Наши требования немногочисленны и рациональны. Даю вам полчаса на отбытие. В ином случае, Землю вы больше не увидите». — И он растворился в воздухе.</p>

<p>«Что за чёрт!» — М рванула вперёд и ощупала место, где до этого стоял Куратор.</p>

<p>«Глазам не верю, он вывернулся с поверхности планеты?»</p>

<p>«Точно так. Не унёс ни единой травинки — и от себя ничего не оставил. Хлопка перепада давления не было. <em>Как он, чёрт побери, это сделал?</em>»</p>

<p>«Давай же, нужно уходить».</p>

<p>«Надо выяснить, как он <em>это сделал</em>!»</p>

<p>«Чего не получится сделать, если нас вывернут на другой конец Галактики — кажется, он именно это имел в виду —, если не уйдём. Он только что показал кое-что очень ценное».</p>

<p>«И что же? Мы даже близко не подошли к возможности делать что-то подобное».</p>

<p>«Но зная теперь, что такое реально, можно дерзать понять, как он это провернул».</p>

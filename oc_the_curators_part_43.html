<p>After M's funeral turned into a celebration of her survival and ran its course, the shipworks people brought us home by aircar.  We left what was left of the <em>Plausible</em> at the shipworks.  We could have flown it home at low altitude ourselves, but I could see that M was not in the mood for anything like that.</p>

<p>Six days later we found our old friend the human-form Curator waiting for us when we returned home from dinner.  He was bearing his usual gift, stupidly expensive Earth liquor, this time a fifth of Chivas Royal Salute -- the good 38-year stuff, not the 21-year stuff mere mortals can afford if they skip a paycheck.  M fetched us shot glasses and we clinked them.</p>

<p>"I came as soon as I heard," he said.</p>

<p>"And how did you hear?" M asked.</p>

<p>"We walk among all of our children, even these, but here our operatives keep a low profile.  We are all very sorry about your ship and glad your vacuum defenses worked as the Witnesses intended.  If you need anything, know that I have been assigned an amplifier belt to assist you until the Promethean project is concluded."</p>

<p>"An amplifier belt?  For <em>us</em>?" M said incredulously.</p>

<p>"This world has been a longstanding thorn in our side, one which the two of you have very nearly now pulled.  It has been a long time since the Curators have owed a debt such as we owe you two."</p>

<p>"Seems like it's done," M said morosely.  "Nothing left to do but wait anyway.  If we could go home without getting hunted down and dissected I'd be ready to leave."</p>

<p>"But then you would miss the best part," the Curator said.</p>

<p>"And what part is that?" M countered.</p>

<p>"The part where your children fly," he said with a sense of gravity.  "Of all the things we can ever experience, this is the thing we long for most and which we remember most fondly.  Very few of us have the privilege of guiding a world through the Critical Path, and far fewer can claim to have done so as an individual effort.  My people will tell your tale for aeons."</p>

<p>"Yay us," M said.</p>

<p>"She hasn't been herself since the near-death experience," I said.</p>

<p>"It shouldn't have had any negative effects.  The Witnesses' methods are a little different than ours but they have been on a solid footing for..."</p>

<p>"...aeons, we know," M said.</p>

<p>"If your plan is to try to live for hundreds of thousands of years, it is a bit of a problem if the most common environmental condition in the universe can kill you in a couple of minutes."</p>

<p>"How are your methods different?" I asked, trying to move to something resembing a topic.</p>

<p>"Curator vacuum defenses concentrate on maintaining consciousness.  After an explosive decompression I can stay conscious for five or six minutes.  This requires specialized energy storage organelles throughout the brain, and we forego some of the Witnesses' techniques to optimize for this.  The reason is of course that I can fold myself to safety if I remain alert.  My window of consciousness gives me enough time to scan and locate a place of safety from almost anywhere in the galaxy.  But if I fail to save myself that way, my long-term prospects once I lose consciousness aren't very good.  I would start to sustain serious damage within an hour, and probably die within three."</p>

<p>"The Witnesses take a different approach, since they know they depend on being rescued by others who will have to reach you in a ship.  So your bodies move aggressively to preserve your brain and organs as soon as a pressure drop is detected.  It actually helps that you lose consciousness quickly so preservative measures can be brought to bear.  One reason it took M awhile to revive once you returned her here is that the protective chemicals and mucous barriers had to be re-absorbed before her body could resume a normal metabolism.  Depending on other conditions you should be able to self-revive after five or six hours in vacuum, and to be revived with proper medical help after as much as a couple of days."</p>

<p>"What about the cold?" I asked, not really understanding the process very well myself.</p>

<p>"Vacuum isn't hot or cold," M said.  "You start cooling down by black-body radiation but it takes hours, and I guess we make antifreeze if it goes too far."</p>

<p>"That's right," our Curator said.</p>

<p>"So why is she so depressed?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"Maybe it's the giant plate of crow I have to eat now," M said as she sat up a bit.</p>

<p>We just looked at her.</p>

<p>"I didn't know about the survival package and I remember what I felt as I watched the dome blow away.  I had enough time to be glad I wouldn't have to face up to how wrong I'd been.  Dying was preferable to having to endure the embarrassment of being so wrong before so many people who had trusted me so much."  She sighed.  "Then I fucking woke up."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," the Curator said.</p>

<p>"I think I do," I said.  "She has been ragging on them for years for settling for tech that is far more primitive than what we really offered them.  The biome for life-support, the glass hull, the glass plate drive tech that will never be quite as good as our silicon wafers.  She thinks they've settled for an easy but soft path."</p>

<p>"And I was wrong," M said heavily.  "Wrong about everything.  If I had any tendency to believe in God I'd see the <em>Plausible</em>'s blowout as a rebuke for my arrogance.  It's somehow even worse that I know it was just my own stupidity paying off."</p>

<p>"I think you are being a bit harsh on yourself," the Curator said gently.</p>

<p>"If we have done so well, if we have earned the praises of future aeons, have you stopped to ask yourselves just what it is about the Prometheans that made your methods fail and ours succeed?"</p>

<p>"We wonder that every day."</p>

<p>"They own everything they do," I said.  "For good or ill, they take responsibility.  This makes them very serious about the provenance of all the tools and materials and techniques they use.  For them failure is tragedy, and worth any cost to avoid.  The Prometheans have a sharp sense of humor, but we have lived here for over thirty of our years and I have never seen a Promethean laugh at another's failure.  They would not understand what humans call physical comedy, or for that matter most of our comedy, at all."</p>

<p>"You give them nanites," M said, becoming a little more animated, "and they ask, how do these things work?  And your answer is... pound sand.  Just take them.  The Promethean asks, how do these things fail?  And your answer is don't worry, they don't, just trust us.  But the Prometheans don't just give away their trust.  You have to earn it by showing performance and reliability.  You know they had a much more sophisticated society than anybody realized when we arrived.  You pride yourselves on how the nanites make a post-scarcity society possible, but the Prometheans had achieved that on their own, all through methods of agriculture and handicraft and social organization that they fully understood.  What you offered them to move beyond that began with an uncertainty of dependence that they hated."</p>

<p>"But how can an agrarian existence begin to compare to what we showed them was possible?"</p>

<p>"Promethean society was much more advanced than anybody realized when we arrived here.  It <em>looked</em> primitive but they are keen observers and they do make modifications to their environment to suit their purposes.  They are just very careful about it.  I just spent a few weeks on a ship with a Promethean biologist, and when they say they understand their biome very well, they aren't kidding.  They are selective about where they try to live and what they try to achieve.  They have not kicked their ecosystem the way we did on Earth and so it remains relatively stable and very productive.  They have practiced agriculture in a way that preserves biodiversity and while antibiotics were a miracle for them, they already had many medicines, some very effective, which they harvested from plants and animals.  Their response when something does go wrong, such as a drought or famine, is to move <em>en masse</em> and the entire population pitches in to help the refugees resettle."</p>

<p>"Then if they were so comfortable how did you get them to progress?"</p>

<p>"We showed up in a ship that was obviously the product of human craft, and told them that we had gone from their level to making such things without mystery gifts so we knew how it could be done.  We made sure that each advance brought them something they could both use and fully understand.  They trusted us because we promised them that they would be able to make everything we gave them on their own, and at each step we followed through on that."</p>

<p>"They just saw the nanites as an instrument of control," M said.  "You had been giving them true knowledge for millennia, which was a big reason their society could work so well.  Then one day you show up with magic Lego bricks and no explanation of how they work or how they were made."</p>

<p>"Well I suppose that's fair," the Curator said, "since the nanites <em>were</em> meant as an instrument of control."</p>

<p>"Nice of you to admit that," M said evenly.</p>

<p>"We always meant for our children to progress beyond using our nanites, but at a rate we could control.  I guess we made them too well because nobody ever went beyond them until you came along."</p>

<p>"We didn't go beyond them," M said.  "You didn't let us know they existed, so we went past them."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we should have done that elsewhere sooner," he said a bit contritely.  He poured us another round of stupidly expensive shots.  "It appears we have our own plate of crow to feast on.  I still don't understand yours though, M."</p>

<p>"Glass doesn't work-harden," she said.  "You can inspect the stresses within it with a couple of polarizing filters and ordinary light.  They read what we brought them about metallurgy and they came to the conclusion that even we didn't understand it to standards they would accept, and they were right.  We use metal because it's light and strong, but when you have supergravity and the fold it doesn't <em>need</em> to be lightweight because the whole thing accelerates evenly no matter how massive it is.  I spent so long flying airplanes that I couldn't wrap my head around that even when they were trying to tell me.  They built the most beautiful spaceship I have ever seen and I told them they were fools."  And she sobbed.</p>

<p>"You have nothing to be ashamed of," the Curator said very positively.</p>

<p>"And how would you know?"</p>

<p>"If they have shown you an error of your ways, you and J have shown us an error of ours that we have been stuck with for seventy thousand Promethean years.  I'm sure even the Prometheans, with their formidable circumspection, have made mistakes too."</p>

<p>"We had to rescue an aircar which was out of control when one of their early pressure suit experiments went wrong," I said.  M nodded.</p>

<p>"And how did they deal with it?"</p>

<p>"They had a nice ceremony for the poor fellow who died and they redesigned the suit and their procedures to try to prevent it from happening again."</p>

<p>"Just as we Curators are learning and thinking about how we will approach our Critical Path children in the future, as well as the changes humans are making in the galactic economy now that supergravity and small fold drives are becoming more common.  Regret your wrongness, certainly, and definitely learn from it.  But unless your wrongness has affected trillions of people on millions of worlds, know that someone has been more wrong than you and for a much longer time."</p>

<p>M laughed for the first time since I'd rescued her.  "I guess that's something," she sniffled.</p>

<p>"I would bet that even the Prometheans would say that wrongness itself isn't the sin, and it is the failure to learn from your wrongness that is.  Learn from your mistake and move on, and know that you have been instrumental in correcting a much larger wrong on our part which we must move past too."</p>

<p>He emptied the bottle into our shot glasses and then said, "Someone is approaching.  I'll go for now.  But I will not be far as long as this project is ongoing."</p>

<p>When the knock on the door came, it turned out to be the director of the shipworks.  "I hope I'm not intruding," he said, "but we've been busy and we have a proposal for you."</p>

<p>We invited him in.  He spread out a small poster filled with Promethean engineering drawings of a spherical ship.  "I hope you don't mind that we've taken the liberty of doing some measurements on your ship and its systems," he said.  "We were hoping to help you get spaceborne again."</p>

<p>"I don't think I could ever trust it again," M said.  "You were right about glass and I was so very wrong about metal in the long term."</p>

<p>"Well, we looked into the possibility of replacing the observation dome but, yes, we were very uncomfortable with making a junction, and wondering about the rest of the metal hull.  So our engineers came up with this.  We think we can make you a new ship in our style, about six meters in diameter, and install all of the drives, controls, and instrumentation from the <em>Plausible</em> in it to make it fully functional."</p>

<p>"No biome ecosystem?" M asked.</p>

<p>"You don't have a bioengineer to keep it running," the director said.  "And you seem to be comfortable with the functioning of your mechanical life support system."</p>

<p>"This is extraordinarily generous," M said.</p>

<p>"Not really.  Our fold drive won't be ready for a few more years, so at the shipworks we have some breathing room.  It would be educational for us to work on a project like this using more of your technology.  And you have spent decades with us making our ship possible, so rebuilding yours is a tiny return for what you've done for us."</p>

<p>M and I made eye contact, and for the first time since the disaster she smiled.  "Then by all means, go for it," she said, and I just nodded.</p>

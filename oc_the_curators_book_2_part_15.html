<p>"A pool table? Really?" Emma said as Quentin took a shot, sinking his ball.</p>

<p>"The barbecue joint is under new management and they offered it to the first patron who could remove it for them," Quentin said as he lined up another shot.</p>

<p>"And how did you haul it off, it's not like you have a pickup..."  Quentin looked at the Curator, then Emma and I looked at him.</p>

<p>"It's a bit large but the range was only twenty-three hundred meters so well within the capability of my implant," he said.</p>

<p>"You used the most advanced fold technology in the galaxy to boost a pool table?"</p>

<p>"It did give us an advantage over the gentlemen who were planning to return with pickup trucks.  And Quentin was kind enough to show me the game."</p>

<p>"So you're a pool sharp too?" Emma asked Quentin.</p>

<p>"Once upon a time," he said with a shrug.</p>

<p>The scotch turned out to be Royal Salute, and the Curator poured us shots.  "So who's winning?" Emma asked.</p>

<p>"Quentin is," the Curator said.</p>

<p>At that Emma and I both raised our eyebrows.  "You have a Curator implant and Quentin is beating you at a simple match of physical skill?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is proving an interesting lesson well worth the diversion of the table.  The simplest strategy is easily modeled, but is not a winning strategy.  Quentin has proven able to use spin to make the ball travel curved paths, and to direct collisions which are far too chaotic to accurately model often enough to exploit them successfully.  While I can control what the tip of the cue stick does far more repeatably and accurately than he can, my implant doesn't have a sufficiently accurate physical model of that aspect of the game to use that control."</p>

<p>As if on cue, Quentin took a shot that sent the cue ball curving around one of the Curator's balls that should have been in the way to knock another of his own into a side pocket.</p>

<p>"Well if his control is less accurate than yours, how is he smoking you at the game?"</p>

<p>"I'm still trying to figure that out," the Curator said.</p>

<p>"I'm willing to take risks," Quentin said, as he made another shot.  "And I'd dispute his opinion of my control.  I'm not analyzing the game as a physical system, but I spent a lot of years doing this and I still have the muscle memory.  I may not know exactly what will happen when I let it fly -- I notice Mr. C here always does -- but it works often enough that I get a lot more opportunities than he does."</p>

<p>"You're too conservative," I said to the Curator.</p>

<p>"Tending projects that take aeons tends to make one a bit conservative," the Curator admitted.</p>

<p>"Yet it seemed like the opposite of that on our tour," Emma said.  "At each step they understood that what they had done or were about to do might not work out.  They said that about ten percent of the final engineered collisions even fail to produce a suitable world."</p>

<p>"Now <em>that's</em> a game of pool," Quentin said as he knocked in the eight ball, winning the game.</p>

<p>"There are parallels," the Curator said pensively.  "We have long-established formulae for how much effort to put into each stage of the process.  It is what you call a cost-benefit analysis where we ask whether more effort and more time will increase the chances of success enough to justify that effort.  At some point long ago we determined that a ten percent failure was acceptable for final engineered collisions because halving that rate, while possible, might increase our commitment to each collision by a factor of ten.  Planetary systems are so large and chaotic that the impossibility of precisely modeling everything is an obvious problem.  It is rather surprising to see the same logic unfolding on the scale of the pool table."</p>

<p>"One of the lessons of our technological adolescence has been that that logic unfolds almost everywhere," Emma said.  "It's why we were able to remake our world with satellite communications and reach its moon with impossibly primitive rocket technology, even though those rockets had a bad habit of exploding now and then."</p>

<p>"And our fold drive," I mentioned.  "They were only <em>pretty sure</em> it wouldn't fold the nearest planet into the Sun."</p>

<p>"Which is why on our first test we made sure the nearest planet would be Mars instead of Earth.  Losing Mars would have sucked, but the prize if we succeeded was interstellar travel.  We took the shot."</p>

<p>"Which you were only able to take because of your spectacularly primitive rockets," the Curator said.</p>

<p>"And it didn't hurt that the Sevillians picked up the cue ball," Quentin added.</p>

<p>"But we didn't know that would happen," Emma said.  "We made the call that the small chance of losing Mars was worth the nearly certain opportunity of gaining the galaxy.  It's a decision I participated in, and I would do it again today."</p>

<p>"We Curators aren't so bold," the Curator said.  "You have two more asteroid station tours arranged, one by the crew who guide worlds from multicellular life to what on your world you have called the Cambrian Explosion, and another by the crew who gets those worlds ready for a Critical Path species to emerge.  As we get closer to the Critical Path, you will see my people become less willing to diverge from practices which have been known to work in the past, because they have put more effort which they don't want to see wasted into getting to where they are."</p>

<p>"Won't we get to see how the Critical Path species are Curated?"</p>

<p>"You will, but that is done very differently.  It doesn't require large crews or hardware so our agents tend to just fold in with our implants carrying such small artifacts as we might need.  Once in awhile we need an amplifier belt.  You'll meet those agents too, and you'll find they are <em>very</em> conservative.  I would know because I am, of course, one of them."</p>

<p>"That thing about not wanting to lose your effort to date -- in gambling we call that the sunk-cost fallacy," Quentin said.  "It sounds like you aren't objectively evaluating the odds any more.  If you were, you would have either seen something like humans ages ago, or we would never have emerged."</p>

<p>"You may be right," the Curator said.  "As life becomes more complicated it becomes ever harder to calculate the probable outcome of an action.  It may be that we are doing what you do when you hit the cue ball, relying more on our memory of what has worked in the past than on a complete analysis of what is possible.  This is worth some serious research on our part because if it is true we have been falling short of our mandate to give chance a chance for a very long time."</p>

<p>"Are either of you novices at this game?" the Curator asked Emma and me.  "I am curious as to how your human tendencies would affect the outcome with neither of us having Quentin's muscle memory and both of us having an implant."</p>

<p>"I'm no sharp but too many weekends in the service there wasn't much else to do," Emma said.</p>

<p>"I've never picked up a cue," I said.  "Medical school doesn't provide a lot of time for recreation."</p>

<p>Quentin gave me the same brief pointers he had given the Curator.  I didn't dominate the table the way Quentin could, but I won six out of seven games as we killed the bottle of Royal Salute.</p>

<p><em>Twenty-Six Hours Later</em></p>

<p>It took about ten minutes for <em>Petunia</em> to alight on my lawn after our microfold
network received its first ping.  That ping included basic ship specifications so I
could tell there was no need to waste time sending it to the spaceport.  I also
alerted the <em>Palomino</em> to begin making preparations for emergency departure.</p>

<p>When the vacuum truck's rear hatch popped open and Callie climbed out, I said "I see
you took my instruction to make sure nobody would recognize it as a starship
seriously."</p>

<p>"I also looked at a couple of milk trucks but I wasn't sure they would be as strong.
Also, they had both once carried milk.  <em>Petunia</em> here is a virgin."</p>

<p>Agent Veronica followed in her usual costume of shades, leather coat, and boots.
"Andrew," she said with a smile.  "Good to see you, but not so much under the
circumstances."  She held up her hand and I accepted the transmission.  I instantly
knew the strength of the repeated attack and that it was repeating every eight
minutes.  There was little chance of it wearing down the defense grid, but the
attacker probably did not realize that.  And we had to stop it of course.</p>

<p>"Do you have anything to eat?  We've been in the ship for over a day and we didn't
take time to bring supplies."</p>

<p>"I'll whip up some pancakes," Sofia said.  "You'll probably want to be going back
with the <em>Palomino</em> and they won't take long to get ready."</p>

<p>I contacted the ship and verified that they would be ready to depart in about half
an hour.  "I'll fold <em>Petunia</em> here over to the <em>Palomino</em> so we can return it to
Earth.  Then I'll come back for you two."</p>

<p>"If the ship is only a klick or so away, I can get both of us there," Veronica said.
"Just beam me the coordinates.  I couldn't handle the truck though."</p>

<p>"Oh, one thing," Callie said and she quickly returned to the <em>Petunia</em>.  She came back 
with the fold drive.  "I'll want to keep an eye on this."</p>

<p>"Not a bad idea, but how will you carry it?"</p>

<p>"If aunt Sofia still has her wire-wrapping tools I'll just make it into a necklace
again like I did on the trip out."</p>

<p>Sofia served the pancakes and brought Callie her wire wrapping tools.  A couple of
minutes later Callie was threading a leather thong through the wire cage's woven bail
and slipping it over her head.</p>

<p>"You took it to Earth like that?" Veronica said with a look of great amusement.</p>

<p>"Sure.  After all it really is just a crystal ball."</p>

<p><em>Forty Hours Later</em></p>

<p>Before making its last fold to the Solar System the <em>Palomino</em> paused to make contact
with our agents on Earth, which was now within communication range.  The attack was 
ongoing and there were eight alien fold ships in orbit.  There were also six on the 
ground but I was sure this attacker would not be following the Keeper's example.  He 
would be in orbit so as not to visit the center of the Sun himself.</p>

<p>Then we folded in.  The <em>Palomino</em> wasn't a totally unexpected visitor to the Earth 
but it was off schedule by several weeks.  Once I was at Earth I was able to attract
diagnostic pings from the attacking amplifier.  I only did this a couple of times 
because I didn't want to alert the attacking Curator to my presence or capabilities.</p>

<p>"The problem is I can't detect the attacker's control signals.  I could if I was close
but if we start maneuvering the <em>Palomino</em> around to get close to each of the alien
fold ships in turn, it will be obvious something weird is going on."</p>

<p>"You need a small platform with life support," Agent Veronica said.</p>

<p>"That's how the Curators normally do such things," I said.</p>

<p>"Use <em>Petunia!</em>"</p>

<p>I looked at Callie.  "That's a generous offer but I have no idea how you built her or
how to fly her."</p>

<p>"Let me do that.  You need to use your kit to find the Curator anyway."</p>

<p>"It could be dangerous."</p>

<p>"This fucker is trying to <em>destroy the Earth</em>.  I think I can take my chances."</p>

<p>"I could use your help," I said to Veronica.</p>

<p>"The shit-sucking truck is cramped enough," she said.  "I have an implant though, and
while it's a B-list human-built implant it should still be adequate to get me to another
ship in Earth orbit.  Send me a microfold ping when you know where you want me and I'll
come."</p>

<p>Callie started making her way toward the cargo bay and I said, "Haven't you forgotten
something?"</p>

<p>She looked at me completely puzzled.</p>

<p>"I left your ship on the <em>Palomino</em>'s vacuum skirt.  With the hatch open."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"Not to worry, I know where it is.  Is there anything I need to do to enable life support
after I close the hatch?"</p>

<p>"Big purple lever opposite the fold drive socket.  Labeled 'AIR'."</p>

<p>"Just a second."  I folded into her ship; I have Curator style vacuum defenses so a few
moments of vacuum exposure are no impediment.  I closed the hatch, found the lever, and
activated it.  A gauge reported rising pressure as air hissed into the chamber, and 
several indicators came on for the other life support monitors.  When I judged that 
it would be habitable for Callie I returned to the corridor and brought her back.</p>

<p>She ripped the wire-wrap cage open and put the fold drive back in its socket.  "Be 
careful not to engage the fold function.  Just use supergravity to move through normal
space.  We've got time and we'd like to preserve your secrecy if possible.  Only the
radars of Earth can track an object this size in normal space and they're all ours."</p>

<p>"Aye aye, sir."</p>

<p>I had looked up the orbits of all the alien ships.  The closest would take us about half
an hour to reach at reasonable orbital velocity.  I gave Callie the coordinates and let 
her pilot her ship.</p>

<p>"It must have been awkward being cooped up in this can with the agent for so long,"
I said conversationally.</p>

<p>"Oh, we entertained ourselves," Callie said.</p>

<p>"Really.  The agent doesn't seem to find much entertaining."</p>

<p>"You might be surprised."  She looked at me and grinned.  "Or maybe not."</p>

<p>We approached the first fold ship and I couldn't detect anything coincident with the
activity of the attacking amplifier.  I directed Callie to the next ship.</p>

<p>On our fourth rendezvous, three hours later, I found what I was looking for.  I had 
Callie circle the alien slowly so I could use the one bit of information I could gather,
the signal strength, to try and tell where my target was.  Finally I said, "This is all
I can do from here.  I'm going to board.  Take <em>Petunia</em> back home on supergravity.
Does her wheeled drive train work?"</p>

<p>"That's how I got her home from the auction house."</p>

<p>"Try to land at least a few hundred klicks from your place in a remote area and drive
her home.  Be careful going through the atmosphere, you don't want to dally but this 
thing doesn't have a heat shield either."</p>

<p>"I can manage.  Go get 'em."</p>

<p>I sent Veronica the coordinates and folded over.  She met me a moment later.</p>

<p>"Where's Callie?"</p>

<p>"I sent her home with her ship.  We don't need them here any more, but we might
need them again later."</p>

<p>The Curator's control blips were now clear.  I slipped Veronica a bit of code for her
implant that would make them audible to her too.  Then we separated to triangulate the
signal.  After an hour or so exploring the massive conventional-style fold ship we
converged on the entrance to a lounge which advertised a large space viewing window.
Not surprisingly, when we entered the window was directed toward the Earth.</p>

<p><em>Do you think the fucker is hoping to see it happen?</em> Veronica asked me by microfold.</p>

<p><em>I just know what I see.  Over in the corner.</em>  There were about thirty individuals
of various races in the room but most were doing the things you do in a bar on a 
starship.  One grey-scaled reptilian specimen was gazing intently out the window though.
There was a drink sitting on the table in front of it but all the ice had melted, and 
it was totally ignoring the bar scene around it.</p>

<p>Veronica and I got drinks and drifted over to its table.  I was monitoring the fold
activity which was now quite clear and as it became about time for the amplifier to
make another attempt I loudly placed my glass on the table and said, "Honey, this guy
looks like he could use some friends.  Friend, do you mind if we join you?"</p>

<p>"I'm busy," it answered in the siphilant dialect of Common.</p>

<p>The attacking amplifier fold comms had hiccupped.  There was no doubt we had our target.
I threw up my own amplifier's local fold inhibitor, which  was tuned not to affect the 
gravity plating as the humans' inhibitor had when Jay and Emma were attacked.  My field
would disable the ship's drive but that was not an immediately bad thing.  The 
attacker's amplifier could probably punch out of my inhibition field but it couldn't do
that while it was configured to conduct its fold attack on Earth.  </p>

<p>Then I took its amplifier away.  Eventually the Curators were going to figure out that
they needed to change that code.  Or maybe they wouldn't; they seemed to have forgotten
a lot.  But I'd have to resort to something a bit more complicated if they ever did.</p>

<p>The alien's eyes widened, and then it looked at us.  Suddenly realizing that the
situation might not be what it thought it tried to fold out, and that didn't work 
either.</p>

<p>"It's too bad we don't have a spare MPTP injector," Veronica said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't need one.  I've learned a <em>lot</em> since we started taking the Curator
implant apart at Terminus."  I reached in through the manufacturing diagnostic
interface and performed the same operation I had on the Keeper's implant, which
would prevent it from following its owner through an externally generated fold.</p>

<p>The alien knew I had done <em>something</em>.  "What was the meaning of that?" it hissed.</p>

<p>"This," I said.  I turned and winked at Veronica, then I grabbed its shoulder and
folded it to the summit of Lars Christensen Peak on the uninhabited Antarctic 
Peter I Island.  I didn't bother to kill it before folding back to the bar.
Of course, its implant hadn't made the trip with it.  Before the implant could time
out I manually took control and reset it and locked out its automatic return to
the manufactory.</p>

<p>"What was that about?" Veronica asked.</p>

<p>"You mentioned having a crappy B-list human-made implant," I said.  "I happen to 
have a fine deal on offer for a better model, just slightly used but clean as a 
whistle and needing a new owner.  I really don't want to leave it unattended 
here at Earth so I can offer you an attractive trade-in."</p>

<p>"You took its implant?  How?"</p>

<p>"I turned off its ability to follow him through another device's fold.  I did that
to the last guy who tried to destroy Terminus, but I didn't kill him.  He had honor."</p>

<p>"You killed the attacker?"</p>

<p>"I left him at the summit of a mountain on a remote uninhabited Antarctic island.
Without his implant to take him to some more hospitable place the Earth will finish 
him off for us.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you do that to Nemesis?"</p>

<p>"At that time I didn't know how.  We've been taking another implant apart in a lab
on Terminus.  And I've been doing a bit of ongoing hacking on my own."</p>

<p>We refreshed our drinks and I told Veronica how to unlock her B-list implant; I
sent it to my stateroom on the <em>Palomino</em> and instructed it to unfold.  I could 
deal with it later.  Then I gave her the Curator implant and put it in new recruit
mode.</p>

<p>"For a few days you will be less capable than you were with the B-list model, but
it will be a good chance for you to return to Terminus with us on the <em>Palomino</em>.
Our researchers will want to interview you while you adjust to it.  You're only 
our second subject who's had both types of implant, and our other subject had 
them in the opposite order."</p>

<p>"I really need to go home.  I have duties."</p>

<p>"There's something else," I said.  You've only ever had the longevity boost and
you're getting noticeably older.  We can fix that.  We have the Cure, and we can
be fairly sure of giving you fifty to a hundred thousand years of healthy youth
in this body."</p>

<p>She sucked in her breath.  "And what would I owe you for all of this?"</p>

<p>"Nothing is owed," I said.  "You earned the Cure by visiting the Pinwheel.  We just
didn't have time to give it to you before the <em>Palomino</em> departed.  And you earned
the stolen Curator implant by helping me to steal it.  I probably wouldn't have
been able to find the attacker without your help to triangulate its position.
And there was nobody else."</p>

<p>"What about Callie?"</p>

<p>"She already has the Cure.  And her current mission precludes an implant; she
has to be absolutely ordinary until the moment we need her.  Same for the regular
crew of the <em>Palomino</em>."</p>

<p>Veronica couldn't yet control her new implant so I folded us back to the <em>Palomino</em>.
There was no safe way to contact Callie without blowing her cover, but the agency
was able to tell us that she made her way safely back to her papercrete dome in her
antique suction truck.</p>

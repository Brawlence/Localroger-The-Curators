<p><em>Three Years Later</em></p>

<p>We had nearly implemented all of the mechanisms necessary for practical bulk nanoassembly but still had integration issues making them all work on the same project.  Nanoassemblers are similar to nanites but they do not reproduce, and unlike nanites they need some kind of external synchronization as well as a rich ecosystem of nanoscale supply lines to get elements and components to the places where they are needed.  Nanites require solutions to some of the same problems but because they can replicate and move around their solutions are very different.</p>

<p>We had some of the simpler nanohelpers of the mortality Cure working in vivo and our team members confidently expected to live at least a thousand years, and our skill was steadily increasing.</p>

<p>One day the fold aperture lab invited us to watch a demonstration.  The team member doing the demo placed a statuette in an aquarium and set a computer to scanning it with an elaborate array of lasers.  When this was done he poured sand over it until it was covered.  Then he gave the computer a different command, and after several seconds the statuette appeared outside of the aquarium and the sand slumped.  "We have to figure out the shape with other methods, but once we have it now we can shape the fold aperture with high precision," he said as his colleagues politely applauded.  There wasn't a single grain of sand on the statuette.</p>

<p>The microfold array team had more work to do though.  The leader showed us a 3D projection of an atomic structure about a hundred atoms in radius and four centimeters long.  "This is one element of an array of what will probably need to be about a hundred million independent microfold transceivers," he said.  "We've managed to synthesize a few of them and make them work individually but bulk nanoassembly still isn't up to creating an array this size."</p>

<p>We had been visited by the Curator once a year, usually at Earth's winter solstice, and we did not talk about our project and he didn't talk about Nemesis.  But then he showed up on March 18.</p>

<p>"Nemesis is dead," he said with an uncharacteristically grand smile.</p>

<p>"How in the hell..." Emma and I both started, but he raised his hand as if to share a vision.  "Brace yourselves," he said, "I've used the amplifier to enhance the recording and playback process."  I closed my eyes so as not to be distracted and then</p>

<p><strong>I AM</strong> the Curator and <strong>I FEEL</strong> the weight of his long years of life and <strong>I REMEMBER</strong> his other hosts and <strong>I AM</strong> the agent of a mission nobody else can complete.</p>

<p><strong>I AM</strong> attending a montage of grisly crime scenes.  <strong>I AM</strong> able to trace her steps but not quickly enough.  <strong>I AM</strong> constantly examining myself and sometimes other Curators for clues that might help me solve the problem of restraining her, but <strong>I AM</strong> making no progress.</p>

<p><strong>I AM</strong> noticing the presence of a figure at many of the murder scenes.  She is a human female with dark hair who always wears a leather trench coat and mirror shades.  <strong>I AM</strong> realizing that she has also noticed me.  <strong>I AM</strong> hearing her voice in my ear.  "I thought nobody else knew," she says in a voice that is both crisp and sultry.  "If I show you mine, will you show me yours?"</p>

<p><strong>I AM</strong> sipping coffee and listening to her tell me some of humanity's best held secrets.  Humans have made more progress on fold technology than anyone has realized.  It reqires a planetary array of detectors synchronized by atomic clocks and supercomputers, but they have learned to track Curator local folding about as well as I can with the amplifier.  They know the murders are all committed by the same Curator.</p>

<p>"I know everyone on Earth who is aware of our project," she says.  "And you're not one of us.  You're a Curator yourself, aren't you?"</p>

<p><strong>I AM</strong> nodding and then <strong>I AM</strong> telling her a story to explain my presence.  <strong>I AM</strong> telling her of the rogue Curator who took an adult human host, but <strong>I AM</strong> leaving out the attempted murder at Seville and the lost blocks and enhanced capabilities and the amplifier.  I am not even sure she knows that such things as amplifier belts exist.  But <strong>I AM</strong> letting her know that I can project a localized inhibitor field and that if the murderer tries to fold out from it that I can follow her.  But then <strong>I AM</strong> reminding her of the burning bioform to new host problem.</p>

<p>"A localized inhibitor field?" she finally says.  "That could be useful."</p>

<p>"But not useful enough.  I have spent years unable to think of the next step."</p>

<p>"Maybe you're looking through the wrong end of the telescope.  Instead of the implant technology, what about the human brain?  You're certain the brain is doing all the processing?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure.  My people are very insistent about that and nothing is ever emulated unless there is no bioform to do the thinking."</p>

<p>"Could you meet me here tomorrow?  I have a friend I'd like to introduce you to."  She writes down the address of a famous hospital half-way around the world, and an office number within it.</p>

<p><strong>I AM</strong> puzzled.  "You can fold on the surface of the Earth to get there yourself?" I ask incredulously.</p>

<p>"Oh no," she says with a chuckle.  "I have access to a private supergravity shuttle.  It will take me until tomorrow to arrange the meeting and get there.  I know you'll just wait until the appointed time and go poof."</p>

<p>At the appointed time I fold over to the office of a prominent neuroscientist.  <strong>I AM</strong> answering such questions as I can about how the interface works, but <strong>I AM</strong> reminding him that for aeons the interfaces have just worked as originally designed, and we don't really know any more just how they target which areas of the brain to establish connections.</p>

<p>"Could you undergo a fMRI scan?" he asks.  "It involves a twelve-Tesla magnetic field, which could be a problem for your implant."</p>

<p>"My implant is isolated in a folded bubble of spacetime," <strong>I AM</strong> saying.  "The magnetic field will not affect it."</p>

<p><strong>I AM</strong> dressed in a hospital gown and being conveyed into a scanner.  <strong>I AM</strong> aware that our methods are so much more subtle and precise than this giant machine, but <strong>I AM</strong> also aware that humans actually understand what they are doing with their technology in ways that Curators stopped even trying to understand themselves aeons ago.  The machine starts by making a basic scan of my brain at rest.</p>

<p><strong>I AM</strong> recording and playing back implant audio and video as they scan my brain and then <strong>I AM</strong> asked to do something consciously directed, if possible without actually folding out of the lab.  I execute a null fold, setting the implant to fold me to my original location.  My implant complains that this is absurd but there is excited chatter in the monitor room.</p>

<p>"Could you project energy in the way that you would to burn your bioform, obviously without actually burning your bioform?"</p>

<p><strong>I AM</strong> executing a microfold array scan of the room and <strong>I AM</strong> selecting an aluminum chair as my target, and <strong>I AM</strong> folding enough solar thermal energy into it to make it glow red and noticeably raise the temperature of the entire room.</p>

<p>There is more chatter in the control room.  Then I am being conveyed out of the machine.  "I think we might have an attack vector," the agent says.  Even indoors she is wearing her trench coat and mirror shades.</p>

<p><strong>I AM</strong> invited to have drinks with her and she shares a shot of Remy Martin XO.  Her plan is a long shot but it is at least possible.  It just has one remaining snag.</p>

<p>"We can only find her after she's gone," I said.</p>

<p>"I know.  We need to work on that.  But first, I was wondering if you had ever had sex as a human."</p>

<p><strong>I AM</strong> hearing it as a simple question and not the prelude to seduction which it actually is.  "No, it would make little sense since one price of the mortality Cure is that my hosts cannot reproduce."</p>

<p>"But isn't your host's body in season all the time since its adolescence?"</p>

<p>"We are trained to suppress those feelings of our hosts which are distracting to our mission."</p>

<p>"I have a mission," she said tossing back her drink.  "And I am eighty years old, I went through natural menopause thirty years ago and I had myself sterilized fifty years ago.  But I am human and I'm still always in season."  <strong>I AM</strong> realizing that at some point she has exchanged her trench coat for a bathrobe, and her eyes are brilliant green.</p>

<p>"If you let him out would your host find me sexually attractive?"</p>

<p>"He had all the imprints which normally cause that to happen."</p>

<p>"Then why don't you let him out?  Surely you might benefit from understanding your quarry a little better.  And your partner."</p>

<p><strong>I AM</strong> about to demur when I realize that I am already a rogue, with secret superpowers and a purloined amplifier belt.  <strong>I AM</strong> realizing that she might have a point.  <strong>I AM</strong> releasing the blocks on my host's sexual feeling as she parts the bathrobe, revealing her nude body, and lets it slide off of her shoulders into a puddle of cloth on the floor.</p>

<p>Nudity is the natural state of almost all of our children, but none of them very often feel as I do now as she approaches me.</p>

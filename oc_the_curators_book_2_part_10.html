<p>Before we returned to 19-bits I took <em>The History of the Humans of Earth</em> to a 24-hour copy shop and ordered five copies.  It was spiral bound but the clerk looked at it quizzically.</p>

<p>"Where did you get this?" he asked.  "I don't think metal spirals have been used in forever, and the dimensions are all weird."</p>

<p>"Can you take it apart and put it back together?"</p>

<p>"Sure, this should just bend...like that."  He unwound the spiral.  </p>

<p>"Just put the copies on the closest standard size you have for both the paper and the binding," I said.</p>

<p>He flipped through the pages, which were in printed Galactic Common, and he said "Wait a minute, was this printed by an <em>alien</em>?"</p>

<p>"Sure was," I said, and I let him scan my payment chip.  An hour later we were ready to leave so we found Quentin and headed back in the <em>Implausible Alibi</em>.</p>

<p>The drive shop foreman looked over the stack appreciatively.  "It would take our best machines a month to make those copies," he said.  "And in much poorer quality.  So did you read it?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," we all said.</p>

<p>He gave us the grinny smile again.  "And you copied it for me anyway?"</p>

<p>"We wanted to know what was being written about us, and a deal's a deal."</p>

<p>"Well we don't get much hard information out here about your people, but he obviously has a bias against you over his exile situation, even though you only built and did not emplace the fold inhibitor."</p>

<p>"We're glad you see that," I said.  "But we had another proposition that might be more useful to everyone.  You said that the Promethean instructions were the bottleneck in getting more drive shops set up?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  A group of sufficiently talented individuals can spin up a shop on just about any indexed world, but they're much too long and detailed to transmit via the microfold, and making a copy takes even our best automated machinery several months.  And copies of copies quickly get illegible so there are really only a few worlds in the business of making new ones."</p>

<p>"You said your shops here share a reference set.  Could we see it?"</p>

<p>"Of course.  I can't let you take it offworld like the history guide though since it's too important and a shared resource."</p>

<p>"Naturally."  It turned out to be at one of the other drive shops, and our host had to vouch for us so we could get in.  The instructions were stored flat, in twenty volumes each of which was about ten centimeters thick.</p>

<p>"Six thousand pages.  We really don't need them very often now that we're producing, but when you're setting a shop up for the first time, especially with inexperienced personnel, you need every one of them.  And once in awhile something goes wrong, and we need to refer back to them; they're very detailed."</p>

<p>"How many drive shops need to be set up out there?"</p>

<p>"Well there are over a million indexed worlds, and at least three million registered capital fold ships all of which are now obsolete until we can retrofit them.  And of course this technology makes much smaller and more numerous ships practical, so I would imagine most worlds would want a shop if they could get one.  There could ultimately be a market for tens of millions of drives.  If there were more sources the bidding wouldn't be so fierce and they would be a lot more accessible."</p>

<p>"We have much faster ways to copy books than the photocopy method we used for your history.  If we want to make a really large number of copies we have big presses that can make a million copies of a book in a matter of days.  Would you allow us to photograph all the pages of your reference set so that we can print a copy for each of your shops, and then for every indexed world?"</p>

<p>"How would you ever do that?"</p>

<p>I held up my cell phone.  "With this.  This feature here is the lens of a camera."</p>

<p>"But how would you store all the information?"</p>

<p>"Oh, this device can easily do that.  It has a memory store capable of holding hundreds of billions of bits of data."</p>

<p>"Incredible!  Then how would you clean up and re-register the pages?"</p>

<p>"We've had software to do that automatically for a long time."</p>

<p>"Well.  Our colleagues would have to agree, but I see no reason why they wouldn't.  This is an extraordinarily generous offer, why are you making it?"</p>

<p>"Because we'd rather be known for something more constructive than that silly history," Emma said.</p>

<p>The instructions were bound so that the volumes could be taken apart to use subsections for on-site reference.  Intead of using the cell phone we went back to Earth and got a dedicated camera and a copy stand so that we wouldn't have to clean up a lot of distortions.  Then Quentin, Emma, and I spent a week and a half methodically photographing all the pages.</p>

<p>Back on Earth Emma and I donned our Royal Couple costumes and appeared before the ruling council of Earth.  I explained the situation.</p>

<p>"So with our help the Prometheans figured out how to build a lower quality but much cheaper landing-capable fold drive.  The natives of CI:174114 figured out how to make it even more easily with their more common nanite based tools.  And now that information sits locked in storage rooms, like medieval manuscripts that have to be laboriously copied, and a million worlds expect to wait tens of thousands of years before they get their chance to see them.  With a much more modest effort than those races put out we can make their instructions available to every world in the galaxy in a single generation."</p>

<p>"And what is our motivation?" someone shouted.</p>

<p>"Very little is known about Earth out in the galaxy.  We are widely known for making an impossibly compact fold drive that nobody else can duplicate and that very few in the galaxy have ever actually seen in action.  We are known for having prevailed in two interstellar wars, which is two more than anyone has seen in aeons.  We are known for creating the device which was used to exile the Sevillians, a device nobody even knew was possible.  And a history of Earth written by a Sevillian who was cut off from his homeworld by the exile is edited to make us seem warlike, vindictive, and selfish.  Across much of the galaxy we are known only to be mysterious and frightening."</p>

<p>"There is little out there to contradict this impression because even with the microfold, its low bandwidth means that information travels slowly across the galaxy.  Even though these are not our plans, we can contribute something no other race can to the efforts of their creators.  We can show that we shared our knowledge, that we recognized and encouraged the accomplishments of those who followed in our footsteps, and now are willing to use our resources to help them help everybody.  We can make sure that every world in the galaxy has a six thousand page book precious to those who hold it, celebrating not our own technology but what we inspired others to make.  And every cover will bear the news that the humans of Earth printed them in a spirit of peace and benevolence."</p>

<p>Emma and I had never really asked the Council for anything except that they try to get along since we unified the government of Earth.  When the vote came to fund our proposal, there were only a few holdouts.</p>

<p>"I thought it sounded better in the original JFK," the human Curator said as he caught up with us later.</p>

<p>"More Peace Corps than Moon landing though," I said with a laugh.</p>

<p>"And a laudable goal which, you might be surprised to find, we thoroughly approve.  Congratulations; you have actually found something worth doing which is beyond our ability as Curators.  We could probably manage it if we wanted to badly enough but really our technology is not pointed in the same direction as yours and it would take us centuries if not millennia to duplicate your mass printing technology."</p>

<p>"Your fold drives are billions of years ahead of our best effort, but we beat you with the <em>printing press</em>?" Quentin boggled.</p>

<p>"Indeed.  Whatever mass industries like that our parent species may have once had have long since been dismantled or destroyed in novae.  Our existence today is largely nomadic, and our largest installations are the craft that continue to Curate new worlds around newborn stars."</p>

<p>"Well that's different."</p>

<p>"There is an area of concern you should think about though.  Assuming you print your million copies of the CI:174144 volume, how do you plan to get them to all the worlds of the galaxy for which they are intended?"</p>

<p>"Um, fold ships?" Quentin said.</p>

<p>"There aren't a lot of fold ships, and few of them can land.  Most of them ply fixed routes called orbits, departing their homeworlds and returning after a fixed circuit of destinations.  Some effort has been made by our children -- with some under the table help from us -- to make sure every world in the galaxy is visited at least once every ten or twenty years.  But the galaxy is a thick tangle of these orbits, often distorted by the rotation of the galaxy itself and political entanglements.  Most of those ships have to be loaded and offloaded by surface landers of limited capacity, and books are heavy.  You will need a plan to get a book from wherever you publish them, Earth or a colony with more and better paper resources, to all the worlds in the galaxy in a reasonable time.  You have the means of publication, but this second problem is distribution."</p>

<p>"We had not really thought of it that way," Emma said.  "We figured fold drives, instant faster than light travel, voila.  Maybe we should have considered distributing tablet computers instead."</p>

<p>"Most of our children would find Earth computers more amazing and worrisome than your fold drive.  That would have been a much more disruptive move which we would not have supported.  And there would be no technical support for your machines a hundred thousand light years from here.  The user interface of a tablet is a much more limited resource than that of a book that can be unbound for use in multiple locations simultaneously.  And all of our children understand books, since writing is part of our Curation."</p>

<p>"Then we just get them the books.  We can make them more cheaply than tablets anyway."</p>

<p>"Not if we make the books right," Quentin said.  "These guys will be using them for centuries.  They need to be on good quality low-acid rag paper.  You should probably find a colony to make the paper that isn't having Earth's ecological problems."</p>

<p>"Well that's great.  We make the damn books and fly them out ourselves if necessary," Emma said.</p>

<p>"It will be far more complicated than that.  Even if all human ships were dedicated to the project it would take you millennia to visit and gift every Indexed world.  Fortunately you already have a resource which will make it much easier."  Emma's eyes rolled and I felt new knowledge pouring into my Curator implant.  "The superintelligence of our implants will make it practical, if not simple, to find an optimal solution to this problem."</p>

<p>"The Traveling Salesman!" Quentin said.  "Given a swarm of destinations, find the shortest path to visit all of them.  And you guys can solve it over the scale of the <em>galaxy</em>?"</p>

<p>"It's a little different but very similar," I said, as the information seeped into my consciousness.  "The orbital routes are fixed so the options are not as great as the general version.  But it's also going to result in a big logistical problem.  Parcels will have to be handed off many times to be relayed to the final ships that will break them into individual sets and deliver them to destination worlds."</p>

<p>"We can help with that.  It is not beyond our discretion to make sure that the transfers go correctly.  And we can help you to plan the routing.  But you are going to have to package your wares carefully to make sure people who have never had contact with a human mail delivery system get them to where they are supposed to be going."</p>

<p>The <em>Grasshopper</em> was deemed an inadequate vehicle for our mission to save Kattegat.  Since we were going to war we needed something tough, maneuverable and mechanically simple and with room for a possible payload, so we were assigned the C130 based <em>Mail Service</em>.  It had essentially been converted to live up to its name, doing package deliveries to the colonies, but it was armed with the sunlight cannon and its fold drive had been calibrated for long-range service by aligning it with <em>Grasshopper</em>'s.  Instead of a chemical rocket RCS it sported a new microfold-sunlight reaction system which used water superheated by the same process as the power generators and sunlight cannon to produce significant thrust and impulse.  It was a cargo model with a large cargo area and the usual C130 big rear door, and when we got to it we found a uniformed Air Force captain waiting for us by a rather provocative object which was mounted in the cargo hold for transport.</p>

<p>"Is that what it looks like?" M asked incredulously.  It was about six feet long and conical, tapering from a base about a half a meter across to a rounded tip.  </p>

<p>"Of course.  It's your hydrogen bomb.  To be precise a W-88 ICBM re-entry vehicle with a yield of about 500 kilotons.  We have hot-wired this one for you with a simple timer to bypass the Permissive Action Link, which I have been instructed to show you how to use.  Congratulations, you two are now a nuclear power."</p>

<p>"And everyone is cool with this?"</p>

<p>"Doctor J, I believe you suggested this yourself and the President has signed off on it.  We are committed to doing everything we can to prevent the destruction of any inhabited world, not just Earth."</p>

<p>As he was showing us how to program the bomb timer our Curator showed up.  "I've been told you are cleared for everything," our instructor said without elaboration, and he continued our instruction.</p>

<p>"I don't know what we're supposed to do with it.  We have no way to launch it on an intercept course without being detected and evaded and maybe destroyed in the process."</p>

<p>"That much is correct," the Curator said.  "We are now certain the <em>Rate of Change</em> is armed with a primitive version of your sunlight cannon, and due to its heavier construction you would not prevail in a sunlight cannon battle.  If you get much closer than an astronomical unit to them via your fold drive they will detect your presence and be able to either engage you or flee."</p>

<p>"Then like I said, what are we supposed to do with this?"</p>

<p>"My people may be able to give you some assistance.  Take this."  He offered us what looked for all the world like a locket.  "When you get within a couple of light-years of Kattegat and your relative velocity less than about 50 kilometers per second -- your calibrated fold drive should be capable of doing that from Neptune in one fold -- open this and press the button.  This will alert our agent on Kattegat of your arrival.  We are setting up a strategy as you fly."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later we were in the air.  Thirty minutes later we were falling toward Neptune, and seven hours later M opened the locket and pressed the button.</p>

<p>Within moments we were joined by a Raider.  But when this raider spoke, its translater just put out English without any raider growling to translate.  "We have met before," she said.  "I am one who walks among our children."</p>

<p>"You were watching over us on our last visit to Kattegat," M said.</p>

<p>"Exactly.  This is quite a situation.  We would resolve it ourselves, but long ago we gave up the building of ships and so while our command of the fold is very accurate, we have become a bit limited in the ability to fold larger objects and dependent on folding to an inhabitable space.  Thank you for bringing one."</p>

<p>"Hey, it's the least we could do," I said.  "How are we going to do this?"</p>

<p>"We are tracking the <em>Rate of Change</em> as it approaches.  It has to use inhabited worlds as way points and we walk among our children with our fold detectors on all of those worlds.  We anticipate it to arrive here in about another eight hours.  They aren't stopping to lick the <em>scree</em>.  It should appear within ten to fifteen light-years of us, and they will have to do another reckoning before folding over to one of the Kattegat system's gas giants to correct velocity.  We should have about twenty minutes to act."</p>

<p>The raider described the plan to us, and M said it was a thing of martial beauty.  "Even with our superior technology we are out-armored, outgunned, and cannot fold very close without blowing our cover," she said.  "If they don't destroy us they simply fold away before we can do anything.  But <em>this</em> is a plan."</p>

<p>Later, the raider simply said, "They are here.  Range point seven light years."  Our fold drive control console lit up and coordinates entered themselves.</p>

<p>"How did you do that..." M said.</p>

<p>"Just execute the fold.  I could do it myself but you are the captain of this vessel.  It will put us about one point five AU from the <em>Rate of Change</em>, outside of their detection radius for your fold drive."</p>

<p>M executed the fold.  At this range the alien ship still wasn't even visible, but the raider knew exactly where it was.  "Our time is short," she said.  "And I need a bit of it," she said closing her eyes.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Feeling the interior layout of the Sevillian ship."</p>

<p>"You can map the <em>interior layout</em> of their ship from <em>here</em>?"</p>

<p>She opened her eyes.  "How do you think we fold between the surfaces of worlds light-years apart?  I'm ready.  Enable the timer and set it for ninety seconds."</p>

<p>"You have got to be fucking kidding..."</p>

<p>"Our time is short," she said again, and I set the timer.  </p>

<p>Moments later the raider touched the bomb and then both she and the bomb disappeared.</p>

<p>Forty-five seconds after that the raider returned, without the bomb.</p>

<p>"I think I have given it good placement to make sure the planet killing drone is thoroughly destroyed.  The carrier ship will be very heavily damaged, but I'm uncertain whether its fold drive will be completely disabled.  These are very massive and solid objects."</p>

<p>"You're sure they didn't detect your folding?"</p>

<p>"We know the limits of their processes very exactly, having made the components ourselves.  Nanite based fold drives cannot detect our activity at all."</p>

<p>Moments later, the raider said "The bomb has gone off.  It has seriously disrupted them."</p>

<p>"I don't see anything," I said.</p>

<p>"It will take about twelve minutes for the light to reach us here," M said.</p>

<p>While we were waiting, the raider said "There is still fold activity.  They are trying to execute a detuned fold.  They aren't close enough to anything for it to couple with reliably but they are trying different configurations.  We need to finish destroying them."</p>

<p>She put coordinates into our fold drive again.  "Fold in to here, about half a million kilometers range.  Their damaged drive won't be able to detect yours at that range and we will be able to see and gauge the extent of destruction."</p>

<p>M folded us in.  We folded inward past the shell of radiation and blinding light and were still well outward of the larger ejected wreckage.  The <em>Rate of Change</em> had been built in the form of a regular octahedron with rounded vertices, and each facet had a large moveable mirror mounted at its center.  Through the telescope we could see that one of its corners had been blown completely off, and what was inside was glowing ominously.</p>

<p>"Those big mirrors are their sunlight cannons," the raider said.  "If we fold over to face the destroyed vertex at close range they won't be able to target us and we will be able to target the deep interior of the ship."</p>

<p>"Won't there be a lot of debris?  There's only a quarter inch of aluminum between us and the vacuum of space."</p>

<p>"As with the light and radiation, hopefully we will fold past all that."</p>

<p>"Hopefully?"</p>

<p>"This is war," M said, and she used the sunlight RCS to exactly match velocity and orient us then executed the fold.</p>

<p>We all donned welding goggles and strapped in in case the gravity plating should fail.  The interior of the fold ship was a seething mass of molten structural material, but the center had been somewhat shielded by the mass of the ship.  "I'm drilling it," M said, and she opened up the cannon.</p>

<p>"They have redoubled their efforts at fold configurations.  At this close range even their damaged drive can detect what we are up to," the raider Curator said.  "They are trying to target us."  We became aware of bits of debris flashing to incandescence around us and dinging our hull, but we were well in the shadow of the ship to all their functional cannons.  Our ship was also buffeted by gas and debris from the hole M was drilling, but she used the RCS to hold us steady.</p>

<p>After about two minutes there was a flare from inside the fold ship.  "Fold activity has ceased," the raider said.  "I suggest retreat."  We folded back to our observation position and watched.  Finally the raider nodded.  "Their fold drive is dead.  If any of them remain alive they won't be for long."</p>

<p>That was the first point in the encounter when it occurred to me that we had just killed a few thousand sapient beings.  People like us in many ways.  But I knew M would remind me that they were enemies that were trying to kill us too, in spectacularly genocidal fashion.</p>

<p>"How sure are we?"  M asked.  "We've gone through too much here to let them slip away."</p>

<p>"As far as my instruments can tell their sunlight cannons should also be dead."</p>

<p>M folded back and resumed drilling.  She didn't stop until the entire fold ship split into three pieces, forced apart by the pressure of boiling gases from within.  "I can now verify that their fold drive is fully destroyed," the raider said."</p>

<p>"Okay.  Thanks for the help."</p>

<p>"No need for that, we Curators bear..."</p>

<p>"Oh shit."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"We've taken damage.  We're leaking air and fuel cell oxygen and I'm not sure about the control surfaces and propellers."  We all went back into the cargo area, which had windows.  The wings were pockmarked with dents and tears and two of the four propellers were missing at least one blade.  "We're in bad shape," M announced.  "I don't think I can get it to the surface of a planet like this.  We might not even make it through the velocity adjustment at Neptune with these leaks."</p>

<p>"There is no need," the Curator said.  "Can you execute one more fold to get us just a bit closer to Kattegat?"</p>

<p>"The fold drive is one thing that does still seem to be working for now."</p>

<p>A few minutes later we held hands and closed our eyes, and when we opened them we were safe in front of the Earth embassy on Kattegat as our faithful ship <em>Mail Service</em> burned up crashing into one of its seas.</p>

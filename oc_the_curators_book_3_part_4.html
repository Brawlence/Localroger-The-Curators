<p><em>Twenty-Eight Hundred Years Ago</em></p>

<p>Humans still hadn't figured out that their world was a collection of finite resources, and
the first empires of Macedonia crumbled as the rich forests were cut down to make fields 
which only remained fertile for a few years before more had to be cultivated.  Agriculture
remained practical along the rivers where regular flooding replenished the soil but the
population thinned as the forests were converted to deserts and the interesting action moved 
to the Mediterannean basin, particularly Egypt where the Nile made long-term agriculture more 
practical, and India and China.  Even with the ability to fold anywhere on Earth and our
long lives it was difficult for the handful of human Curator-agents to keep up with the 
ebb and flow of human conquest and collapse.</p>

<p>I heard tales of a secretive school on a southern Italian island called Croton where
some of the ideas of which I was told seemed remarkably progressive.  This turned out to be
only partially true; it was a small paranoid club that taught aesceticism and some odd
philosophical ideas along with the beginnings of an understanding of mathematics that was
new even to me.  Those teachings were heavily rooted in visualizations of shapes and an
exploration of their geometric properties.  I had to also swear to my colleagues that I
had not somehow given them the idea that souls are immortal and return to new bodies after
death; after all, in their circle that was only true of me.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately they completely eschewed practical applications of their philosophy, and
regarded some concepts such as the existence of the dodecahedron and irrational numbers
to be too dangerous to reveal to those outside of the group, so at the time I was fairly
sure nobody would remember Pythagoras or his followers.</p>

<p>The graphical geometric method of approaching mathematical problems was new and seemed 
very clever to me.  All Curators have implants, which are fairly powerful supercomputers
even by modern human standards, so we tend to use numerical methods to solve problems 
and we have long known the solutions to those equations we might need to use.  And we tend
to give those answers to our Curated children as needed before they need to work them
out from first principles.  It has been a long time since any of us had to work out 
something as basic as a trigonometric relation using only our brains and lines drawn
in the sand.</p>

<p>But even though the Pythagoreans did have some ongoing influence, particularly and most 
importantly on Aristotle, none of the thinkers of that era could move past the idea that 
such lofty thoughts might somehow be soiled by their application to everyday practical 
matters.  And so those lofty thoughts remained curiosities which had little effect on 
the lives of most humans.</p>

<p><em>Present Day: Eight Years Later</em></p>

<p>I made a habit of being present when the <em>Palomino</em> returned from the Milky Way.
There were detectors for the contraband we most worried about but the most sensitive
detector at the Pinwheel was my amplifier.  It was not ordinarily possible to detect
a Curator implant or amplifier at a distance, but some of the engineering diagnostic
services I had uncovered could trick an amplifier into revealing its presence even if
it had been stealthed.  As the passengers debarked my amplifier received an answer to
its diagnostic ping, and I became aware of all kinds of deployment information.</p>

<p>Over the microfold I issued a priority one alert to all the usual people, and I started
trying to work out who my mark was.</p>

<p>Almost everyone who arrives at Terminus was invited by somebody, and so there is someone
at the spaceport to meet them.  Of the dozen or so who remained milling around and obviously
unfamiliar with local customs, I was able to figure out why they were alone with only one
exception, a young man who looked to be in his early twenties and who walked with a 
familiar sense of confidence despite his unfamiliarity with the situation.  I set my
amplifier to rapid range acquisition and it pinged frantically as I approached him.</p>

<p>"Welcome to Terminus," I said brightly.  "Can I help you with anything?"</p>

<p>"I'm guess I'm looking to find a room while I get my bearings."</p>

<p>"Not a bad idea, and not hard here.  You want to go up to the balcony cafe?  You can get
a drink and I'll point out the landmarks.  You can still get a room almost anywhere in
town but there are better and worse neighborhoods as anywhere you know."</p>

<p>"Sure," he said.  He of course didn't have to worry that I might be some kind of predator
trying to take advantage of him, since he was immortal and could escape any kind of
attack or confinement.</p>

<p>Upstairs I pointed out the major landmarks of Terminus City, then casually said "So how
old are you?  I'm only about a million, and sixty K in this human host."</p>

<p>He froze midway in transferring his bloody mary to his lips.</p>

<p>"Let me guess, they told you nobody could tell."</p>

<p>He finished taking his sip, then slowly nodded.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of things the Curators are less than truthful about.  And a few they don't
even <em>know</em>.  You strike me as being a bit green, so I don't think you are taking a human 
bioform.  You were born human and are freshly recruited."</p>

<p>I threw up a local fold inhibition field before he could sprint.  He could have still led
me on a chase but he was bewildered when his fold senses didn't work as usual.  "One of
those things they don't know about," I said gently as his eyes widened.</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Surely they told you about the rogue Curator you might meet."</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Sloppy even by their standards.  I'm guessing you don't know about the amplifier either."</p>

<p>"The what?"</p>

<p>I had been streaming more and more data less and less discreetly and finally I instructed 
it to appear.  He found himself wearing a thick belt.</p>

<p>"What the fuck!"</p>

<p>"That is the material avatar of a Curator fold amplifier.  You'd command it to appear 
like that to let other Curators know you're carrying big power.  Like this."  And I made
mine appear.</p>

<p>I sensed the cavalry approaching and over the microfold asked them to hold back except for
Sofia, who I asked to join us.  To my mild surprise everyone agreed to this.</p>

<p>"What does this thing do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well usually they're used for moving small worlds around in forming solar systems to 
create the conditions for forming habitable worlds," I said.  "But I use mine for a lot
of specialized research.  And I think yours is programmed to destroy this world."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Tell me, how long were you planning to stay here?"</p>

<p>"Just a short visit to scope the place out.  They said the galaxy was full of probes that 
would help them locate my exit point when I got here."</p>

<p>"Did they tell you <em>which</em> galaxy?"</p>

<p>"Andromeda of course," he said.  "That's where...<em>they</em> thought I would be going.  But on
the ship they told me this would be Messier 101."</p>

<p>"That's right.  Look kid, you got a name?  I know they tell you names are obsolete in the
Curator biz, but take it from me we're both very human and you're gonna get tired of 
being That Curator Guy.  I'm Andrew."</p>

<p>"Thomas," he said sheepishly.</p>

<p>"You should be like your namesake in the Bible and doubt more," I said with a little smile.
"I'm trying to figure out what trigger your amplifier is set for.  It had to 
passively allow itself to be carried here by over a thousand folds initiated by another drive,
and it's not a natural thing for amplifiers to do that."</p>

<p>"It's not <em>mine</em>," he said.  "I had no idea.  They said I would be immortal."</p>

<p>"And you probably are, mostly.  We have people who can make sure they really did give you 
the mortality cure,  and who can give it to you anyway in case they didn't.  Everyone here
will live fifty to a hundred thousand years, at least if some asshole doesn't fold the 
planet they're standing on into its sun."</p>

<p>"This is a trap?" he said with actual horror in his voice.  Just as Sofia rounded the 
corner into view.</p>

<p>"Wow, it's an amplifier party," she said.  "I should probably be dissolving in lust."</p>

<p>"Ah, here it is," I said as the diagnostic worm finally hit paydirt.  "Now that you've
folded to a <em>world</em>, when you're folded away by an external drive it <em>won't</em> passively
go along.  It will stay here, and then..."  I traced the event handler.  "While you
sail off back to the Milky Way, this here world you visited visits the center of its
host star.  Or it would if we didn't have defenses the Curators don't know about for
that sort of thing."</p>

<p>He finished his drink and signaled for another one.  "I didn't know," he said limply.</p>

<p>"I believe you."  I glanced at Sofia.</p>

<p>"Curators," she just said with a shrug.</p>

<p>"Would you like to be rid of it?"</p>

<p>"Please, you can do that?"</p>

<p>"Sure.  Let me erase this stupid script and reset the war locks."  I closed my eyes
for a second to focus.  Then I said to Sofia, "Honey, I have a gift for you."  And she
found herself wearing the belt.</p>

<p>"Um, how is this supposed to work?" she said.</p>

<p>"Our implants aren't all that good at folding but they implement the whole comm protocol
for amplifier control.  When you're using an amplifier you're using its fold engine and
microfold arrays anyway.  I'll have to show you the ropes but now you can move moons 
without my help."</p>

<p>"<em>Your</em> implants?" Thomas said.</p>

<p>"Yes, implants made by humans.  Not up to Curator standards but our people are working on
improving them."</p>

<p>"They didn't tell me you could do that."</p>

<p>"That's because we've very carefully kept it a secret," Sofia said.  Then she looked down
at the belt and said, "There <em>is</em> a way to make this thing invisible, right?"</p>

<p>I nodded and sent the command.</p>

<p>"Thomas, I would like to offer you a deal.  Are you open to an offer?"</p>

<p>"I suppose.  I was so proud and happy to have been picked, and now I realize I was just
a...a..."</p>

<p>"Patsy," Sofia said.</p>

<p>Thomas nodded and sobbed gently.</p>

<p>"I offer you a trade," I said.  "Let us take possession of your Curator implant.  Unlike 
your king and queen and myself, who have been using our implants for a long time, you 
don't have much invested in yours.  Give it to us to study and we will give you one of our
prototypes to test.  Your experience will be valuable because you'll be the only human
being to ever experience using both types of implant.  Your feedback will be invaluable
to our researchers who are trying to improve the user interface.  And as we improve our
kit you'll get upgrades."</p>

<p>"You would offer me this after...after what I almost did here?"</p>

<p>"You were used hard by forces you don't understand.  They expected that after your return
you would easily be recruited into full loyalty because you would be so alienated from
your birth species.  By studying your Curator implant, which we can do destructively if
we need to because it isn't hosting your personality yet, we can learn much that might
help us to improve the ones we are making for ourselves."</p>

<p>He took a long sip of his new drink.  Then:  "Well I would kind of have to be an idiot to
turn that down.  And besides, you could just kill me and take it anyway if I refused,
couldn't you?"</p>

<p>I just signaled the bartender for a glass of wine and Sofia gazed off into the distance.</p>

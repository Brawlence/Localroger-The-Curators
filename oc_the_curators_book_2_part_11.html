<p>We met the gaggle in a warehouse full of rolls of paper.  The aliens gasped when they realized the scale of the place.  The rolls were stacked on pallets, each roll about two meters wide and two meters in diameter.  The warehouse was over a hundred thousand square meters, and it was full.  Emma and I were in our King and Queen outfits to give the official tour.</p>

<p>"Welcome to Earth," Emma said.  "And specifically, to the Punjabi Print Works, where we are printing the galactic edition of <em>The Promethean Fold Drive Construction Guide</em>."</p>

<p>There were about twenty aliens in the group, most of them journalists.  "This is a lot of paper," one of them said.</p>

<p>"Actually, this warehouse only holds enough paper to print about one of the twenty volumes in our full print run.  We are continually resupplying from the human colony of Sao Paulo, and it will take about forty trips with one of our largest fold ships to supply the entire print run."</p>

<p>We motioned to follow and led them through double doors to the print works.  It was a loud environment so I motioned for everyone to put on the headphones we had provided, customized in advance for those whose heads might not be quite human in geometry.  "Can everyone hear and understand me?" Emma asked.  Being Curators, we didn't actually need the prop microphones we were wearing, but we didn't want to show off too much.  Everyone made the gesture equivalent of nodding for their species, and Emma pointed out one of the presses, which was being loaded with one roll of paper while another spun out.</p>

<p>"This is one printing press.  It is printing an eight-page section of the manual... this one here, in fact."  A check copy was posted on the side of the press.  "It will use up one of those rolls of paper every six minutes.  So that it does not sit idle, the lift truck operator replaces one roll and threads it while the other is being consumed; the machine switches over on its own when the live roll is exhausted."</p>

<p>While we watched the forklift operator threaded the roll he had just delivered, and sure enough when the live roll spun out that one started spinning up.  The forklift operator took the empty core with him as he drove off.</p>

<p>"This facility has twenty of these presses.  They are complicated machines that need a lot of maintenance so we generally have fifteen going at any given time.  We have eight lift truck drivers to keep them supplied with paper, and an automated ink supply fed from tanks on the roof.  These are rotary presses, which roll across the paper to deposit ink from etched type blocks, which have to be curved to the radius of the print drum."</p>

<p>We walked on under ribbons of paper flying overhead, moving much faster than the eye could follow.  "Above us, the ink that was just printed is drying before the pages are folded," Emma said.  A little later the ribbon of paper saw swallowed by another machine, which spat out a neat succession of folded and bound pamphlets, which were automatically stacked onto a pallet.</p>

<p>"Here the paper has been folded into sections we call <em>signatures</em> which will be stored until we have enough of them to print a complete volume."  We passed into an even larger warehouse where pallets of signatures were staged as far in both directions as the eye could see.  "This warehouse is ten times the size of the paper roll warehouse, nearly a million square meters," Emma said.  "In order to get to the bindery, we've called an electric bus, because it's nearly four kilometers from here."</p>

<p>"Any questions?" Emma asked as the silent bus pulled out.</p>

<p>"I thought I understood the scale of human constructions," one of them said.  "To make something as novel as your fold drive obviously takes works on a scale we had never seen.  But one of the first things we learn in Curation is to make books, and that you are doing this to make something so familiar -- <em>books!</em> -- is astounding."</p>

<p>"Do your people ever print on this scale for other reasons?" another asked.</p>

<p>"Actually we do, all the time," Emma said.  "The population of the Earth is about eight hundred million, so it's not unusual for a million or more of us to want a copy of something popular.  Many of us favor books over computer displays; they don't need power, they don't break down, and you can make marginal notes in them."</p>

<p>"You <em>write</em> in your books?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we do have libraries where books are shared but most of us own books too.  It's why we invented printing on this scale."</p>

<p>We reached the bindery where the signatures were being staged for assembly into complete copies of volume 3.  "This machine gathers the signatures, aligns them, and prepares them for the binder.  Normally this step would also involve gluing the pages together, but your guides need to be separable so you can take sections to different parts of a fold shop.  So here they are pressed together and trimmed."  This machine was enclosed but made impressive chopping noises; what emerged were neat stacks of paper that had been trimmed of their folded edges and punched for loose binding.  These passed a short distance into another machine where they emerged with covers and screw-stud binders holding them together.</p>

<p>"And here is the finished product.  We have only one binding line specialized for this run and as you can see it produces about one book per second.  So we could theoretically finish the run for each of the twenty volumes in about twelve days, but in practice these machines can't run continuously; they need maintenance and adjustment, so it will take about twenty days per volume.  We expect the whole project to take about a year and a half, and then we will start working on distributing them to every Indexed world in the galaxy."</p>

<p>We finished up in a little auditorium where we took questions and observations.</p>

<p>"When you told us you were going to print a copy for every world in the galaxy we thought it would be the work of generations," one of them said, and others made gestures of agreement.  "The idea that you can do something like this in a year or two... that is going to be difficult to convey to our audience.  None of us have ever seen machine works of such complexity on this scale.  Are there other facilities like this?"</p>

<p>"There are many facilities like this.  Without nanites, this is how humans learned to do almost everything.  For us this facility isn't even that exceptional; it's just the one that won the bid for the job."</p>

<p>"And why are you doing this?  Your economy requires exchange in kind for all transactions, so what are you getting out of this?"</p>

<p>Emma looked at me; diplomacy time.  "Like our fold drive, our printing industry was invented to solve a problem you don't have, because you have nanites.  We would have liked to give you our fold technology, but our experience with the Hyacinth showed that you just don't have the underpinnings we were forced to develop to make it possible.  Instead, you have nanites and for you work is a privilege instead of a survival imperative.  But the Prometheans started with our ideas and showed that there was another way to make fold drives, still superior in performance but within your grasp to produce.  We were happy that others could benefit in a real way from what we had learned after all."</p>

<p>"But then we visited 19-bits and learned of your problems getting a copy of the instructions.  But why should this be a problem?  We had solved that too!  And again, we can use our skill to help the rest of the galaxy.  We are not all driven by greed and power lust.  You would have to ask the Curators why they deprived us of the gifts that made your critical path so much easier to walk, but whatever their reason was it turned out that their denial was really their greatest gift to us.  And this project is a small gesture on our part to return that gift to you."</p>

<p>The journalists returned on the electric bus and Quentin stayed with us.  After they were gone he said, "You know, if you weren't already King of Earth I'd suggest you might run for President.  Just be careful about visiting Dallas, OK?"</p>

<p>"JFK wasn't bulletproof," Emma said.</p>

<p>Emma took Quentin's hand and we folded back to the <em>Implausible Alibi</em>, and took the ship back to Terlingua.  The printing operation was well in hand, but we only had a year or so to figure out exactly how to get our gifts to the worlds for which they were intended.</p>

<p><em>Note:  I am unsure yet whether there will be a new episode on Jan 19, since I will be spending the week out of town on business.  If I don't have time to write, the Curators will definitely return on Jan 26.</em></p>

<p>I busied myself working with M and her colleagues on a number of working groups, trying to figure out how to best defend Earth and our new colonies and to deal with our suddenly dubious position within the galactic culture.  Then one night I woke up stone cold alert straight out of a dream as if I'd been ejected from it, and woke M up by shouting "I KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS!"</p>

<p>M stirred in her sleep and said "fix it in the morning."</p>

<p>In the morning I went to the facility commander and told him I wanted to make a proposal to everyone at once.  I had been something of a hotshot alien specialist before being attacked by aliens myself, so this was given some priority.  After another week we filled a conference room with scientists, engineers, military brass, and a couple of politicians.  I had told them only that I had a possible comprehensive solution to our raider problem, and I wanted to present it all at once so it could be digested, challenged, and defended all at once.</p>

<p>"We have big problems," I opened.  "We know we can kill a raider ship and prevent it from folding our world into the Sun, but we also know they like to park their fold ships stationary with respect to the ground, so that they fall if they can't fold out, and a three mile wide fold ship is a hell of a falling object.  It's not fair but the Sevillians have ostracized us and there is a limit to what we can ask of the Pompeiians, much less the other races we have even less contact with.  And we all know how much help we've gotten from the Curators."</p>

<p>I paused for a moment.  "I have a simple proposal.  I know it will sound strange but I ask you to hear me out.  I propose that we find the raiders and <em>give</em> them everything they tried to steal, and at least one more thing beyond that."</p>

<p>To call what happened next in that room "pandemonium" would be to do it a disservice.  In the front row M regarded me with eyes widened by shock, and the Cabinet member who had come to Pretoria to fetch me regarded me with strange calm.  He eventually got up, joined me onstage, pulled a service pistol and fired it into the ceiling.  I was thinking it must be loaded with blanks when I felt bits of plaster falling on my head.</p>

<p>"Shut the fuck up and let's hear him out," he said.  Then he turned to me and said, "This better be good, son."</p>

<p>"First," I said, "We need to talk about Vikings."  And I talked about Vikings, and many other things, and there were protests and challenges and counterarguments and after four hours a speaker phone call to the White House.  And after that the decision was made to follow my recommendation.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised to find the door to M's dorm unlocked.  She had even gotten a fresh bottle of bourbon.  Moving in silence she made me a drink and handed it to me.</p>

<p>"I hope you aren't..."</p>

<p>"Part of me wants to kill you," she said in a tone that made it very clear she would be quite capable of doing that if sufficiently inspired.  She poured herself a drink.</p>

<p>"And the other part of you?"</p>

<p>She knocked the entire drink back.  I had the sense she had done that a few times before I arrived.  "That part knows you're right.  God help us."</p>

<p>"Did someone call for help?" a familiar voice asked.</p>

<p>"I thought you hardly ever communicated directly with your children," M said.</p>

<p>"You have proven more <em>extraordinary</em> than most.  I would not have missed that presentation for anything.  Very surprising, of course.  Not at all what any of us expected."</p>

<p>"And what would you think of your troublesome raider children spreading out through the galaxy?"</p>

<p>"As with yourselves, as long as they do not molest the critical path worlds we don't care.  Developed worlds have everything the raiders do, and as for the others our mandate is carbon based intelligent life on as many worlds as possible.  You and the raiders are both carbon based intelligent life forms."</p>

<p>"And how many worlds get destroyed in the process?"</p>

<p>"It has been over a billion years since a world was folded into its star," the Curator said.  "We live much longer than you, but we are not immortal, so you two are the only living beings in the entire galaxy who have ever actually seen it happen in person."  He bowed his head.  "And it was my people who did it the last time, for reasons I'd rather not discuss."</p>

<p>"Wow," M and I said more or less at the same time.</p>

<p>"Anyway, you spent some time discussing the first quest of your proposal, finding the Raiders, since they are on the other side of the galaxy and didn't leave a calling card."  He extended his hand and offered me a folded Post-It note.  When I opened it I saw a hand written seven digit number.</p>

<p>"We recently gave you a map of the galaxy," he said.  "Every developed world is listed.  The list is indexed.  That number is the index of the raiders' world."  And poof, he disappeared.</p>

<p>This new gift turned what had seemed like a long term project into a much shorter term one.  After much discussion everyone agreed that there was only one team to send on the first mission, and we decided to use the original C130 <em>Boxcar</em> rather than one of our newer and more capable ships.  We did upgrade its fold drive, and install better fuel cells for out of atmosphere power.</p>

<p>The engineers had a bit of work to do on one part of my proposal, particularly working out how to adapt some of it to a nanite-based technology.  But as I had guessed, it was a reasonable challenge.</p>

<p>Being on the other side of the galaxy, the raider world was moving at about 400 kilometers per second relative to Sol and the Earth, and it took ten hours of falling toward Neptune with twelve folds to rough out the difference.  Before we folded across the galaxy we were going fast enough to go from the Earth to the Moon in about an hour.</p>

<p>And then we didn't fold out to the exact coordinates.  Our instruments aren't calibrated to that kind of precision, and we had never folded such a distance before.  M was learning as much as she was practicing skill as she figured out where we were based on the known points on the galaxy map and sharpened our position toward the raider homeworld.  Finding the world itself, the other worlds of its system, a suitable gas world to use as a thrust attractor, and actually matching velocity took two more days.</p>

<p>The raiders could of course detect fold activity, and when we made low orbit they were waiting for us.  "You've never done this before, have you?" was our greeting.</p>

<p>"Not from such a distance," M said.  "We seek the beings known as raiders.  We bring gifts."</p>

<p>"We are the raiders, but others would warn that buying us off doesn't work."</p>

<p>"We do not bring Danegeld."  I was pretty sure that translated as <em>scree</em> on the other end.  "We seek partnership."</p>

<p>"Others would warn you that we make treacherous partners."</p>

<p>"The same could be said of us.  Would you at least hear our proposal?"</p>

<p>"Your craft is puny.  We could destroy you easily."</p>

<p>"This is true.  And unlike our last encounter, this time we come unarmed.  We do not want to destroy another of your ships or another world."</p>

<p>There was a long pause.  "How do you propose to make landfall?"</p>

<p>"We need a flat strip of land."  We knew how to describe it in common galactic units.  "A vehicular road, beach, or desert flat might be available."</p>

<p>"We will contact you on your next orbit."  A little over an hour later we received a detailed description of how to get to what turned out to be the roof of a seriously large building.  We had to make a couple of folds and fall a bit to get in the right position and then M brought us down, gliding down through the increasingly close-up and detailed images they sent us.</p>

<p>Everyone who greeted us was armed, and there were a lot of them.  The raiders weren't quite feline; they were furry and their ancestors obviously carnivorous hunters, but they didn't quite resemble anything familiar.  They reminded me more of lemurs than anything else on earth.  They all pointed their weapons at us as one of them stepped to the forefront and said, "You say you bring gifts."</p>

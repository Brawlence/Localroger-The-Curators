<p><em>Four Years Later</em></p>

<p>It had been six months with M working on some super-secret project she couldn't even talk to me about, and me doing diplomatic missions.  I'd learned to fly, and even though it wasn't official and I should have had no business going near an airplane much less a starship the Director had decided on his own authority that my skills were sufficient to take control of a machine that cost tens of millions of dollars to build and guide it to the stars.</p>

<p>The flying part was a little easier for me because when you're coming in from space you can pick a landing spot that has good weather and daylight.  Still, not all of the alien airstrips are up to human standards so some care is necessary.  But my function was mostly diplomatic and commercial.  Humans weren't selling our number one product, the miniature fold drive, to other races yet because it still cost us over ten million dollars to build one of them and we were absorbing our own entire production of one every month or two.  But we were using the ships we built to provide a service lots of races were willing to pay for -- next day delivery.</p>

<p>For aeons the rule was that interstellar travel took about a month.  The actual journey for the foldship only took a day or two, but because the ships were so large and couldn't land loading and unloading them from orbit could take weeks.  It was an enormous logistical nightmare that nobody had ever really solved.  But then along come humans, who for a price can be there in less than a day, pick up your load whether it be emergency disaster relief or guests for a royal wedding, and have you to your destination in just a few more hours.  We had far more requests for business than we had ships to provide service, and about forty human employees just working on appropriate methods of payment that we could usefully accept.  Most of the galaxy didn't use money, and we had to establish products and raw materials that made sense as barter.  We also had people working on what we were pretty sure would become a galactic bank because the barter thing was becoming such a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>But now M was done with her secret mission and we had some time together.  When I met her I saw that our friendly human-form Curator was already there too.  "You said you had something really special to show me," I teased.  "I thought it would involve less clothes."</p>

<p>"Later for that.  We can always boink, but you don't always see the first of a new generation of starship."</p>

<p>M led us out behind the hangar where a really strange craft was parked.  It had three somewhat normal-looking aircraft hulls linked by connecting tunnels and struts, and it was sitting on pylons instead of wheeled landing gear.</p>

<p>"The good ship <em>Trinity</em>," M said by way of introduction.</p>

<p>"I thought you were an atheist," the Curator said.</p>

<p>"She's named after the character from <em>The Matrix</em>."</p>

<p>"So our next-level interstellar craft is a trimaran?" I teased.</p>

<p>M laughed.  "You should be so glad you weren't involved with those discussions.  We're obviously still using a lot of aircraft parts because they are readily available, but <em>Trinity</em> was never an airplane.  Cylinders are still the second-best shape for a pressure containment vessel that has to maintain atmospheric pressure in space.  We could have used a single bigger one, but that would have been more vulnerable; <em>Trinity</em>'s three hulls can be isolated from one another.  We have been in shooting wars, remember.  All four connecting tunnels can be isolated and used as airlocks.  Her primary piloting station is in the center hull with the large transparent forward hemisphere, but she can be piloted from anywhere by wire and the safety glass windows in the side hulls are much stronger than the primary cockpit transparent dome.  She's a prototype, and in this form her left hull is configured for passenger service and her right hull for cargo with a C130 style rear cargo door.  The middle hull is propulsion, engineering, and logistics."</p>

<p>"How does she get to the ground without wings?" I asked.</p>

<p>The Curator smiled as M answered.  "You know, our biggest surprise at getting our payment for the Seville fold inhibitor is that gravity plating is yet another fold application.  It's like the microfold we use for communication and the sunlight cannon and power reactor, but it is even more restrictive and only passes gravitons.  We had no proof gravitons even existed and now we're using them."</p>

<p>"I thought it would take a particle accelerator the size of a solar system to detect them," I said.</p>

<p>"It did," the Curator said.</p>

<p>"So gravity plating scarfs up gravitons from all sources through a really detuned microfold, as does levitation plating which is gravity plating turned upside down and backward which is what powers the flying cars.  But we realized that we could use the same principle in a tuned fashion, since we're making our own fold hardware.  So we can make a gravity microfold to some place with really usefully intense gravity flux, like a neutron star.  <em>Trinity</em> doesn't have to fold out to Neptune and fall to adjust its velocity.  It can fold Neptune's gravity to wherever it is.  And even better it can fold the gravity of the Sun or a neutron star or black hole to wherever it is.  <em>Trinity</em> can accelerate at over a hundred gravities.  Once we have the controls perfected it should be able to take off from Earth, match velocity with Kattegat, fold over and land in about an hour."</p>

<p>"That sounds a bit dangerous," I said.</p>

<p>"Actually it isn't," the Curator said.  "We once made ships similar to this.  Since the gravity field affects all particles of the ship equally, there are no tidal forces or internal acceleration.  Should the drive fail the ship would simply stop accelerating; there is no hazard of mismatched correction.  And the graviton microfold doesn't pass any of the other extreme environmental hazards."</p>

<p>"Have you done any of this stuff yet?"</p>

<p>"Space trials only," M said.  "I wanted to offer both of you the chance to be with me for the first real journey."</p>

<p>"I accept gratefully," the Curator said.</p>

<p>"And I guess I do too."</p>

<p>Because it was on relatively short shock-absorbing pylons instead of tall landing gear, <em>Trinity</em>'s connecting tunnel hatches folded down into staircases that neatly met the ground.  "Where are we going?" I asked as M fired up the ship's systems.</p>

<p>"I was going to ask for suggestions."</p>

<p>"I do have one," the Curator said.  "Do you have pressure suits on board?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"I have been asked to do an errand which would normally involve bothering those Curators who are keepers of our powerful technology.  But if this ship can land on an airless world, we could let them sleep."</p>

<p>"Well, that sounds like a good idea.  Let's start by landing on a closer airless world."  We sat in the jump seats behind M in the center fuselage piloting station.  <em>Trinity</em> arose silently from the surface of the Earth, then tilted upward and shot forward vertically for a few minutes until we were in the blackness of space.  No fold maneuvers were necessary to divest ourselves of Earth's air.  When we were well into space M folded us out to Earth's Moon.</p>

<p>At the Moon we adjusted velocity in seconds and descended, until we were looking at the descent stage and flag of an Apollo mission.  "I'm not going to actually touch down and desecrate this place.  I wouldn't have come here at all if I had to use thrusters to descend.  But this is the landing place of Apollo 17.  We are the first people to see it with our own eyes since Cernan and Schmitt left here in 1972."</p>

<p>"This is a great honor," our Curator said, and I think he meant it.</p>

<p>"Where do we go from here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"If I may," the Curator said.  "There is an outer world in the Seville system where I have a chore to do.  It is well outside of the reach of your fold inhibitor, which is why it is there."</p>

<p>M folded us off to the Seville system.  At the Curator's directive she homed in on a spot on its fourth rocky planet, a frozen wasteland similar to Ceres.  There was a modest sized machine on the surface with a small array of stick antennas.  After we touched down the Curator suited up, went out to the device, and touched it with an object he had brought with him.  Minutes later he was back in the ship.</p>

<p>"That's our back channel relay," he said after unsuiting.  "The natives have no knowledge of it, it's entirely for the use of our stay-behind Curators.  But they had been getting some interference from local radio transmissions.  We had quite forgotten to give our people the ability to reprogram its frequency profile remotely, since we're kind of used to being able to get to these things in person.  The program update I just performed fixes that for them."</p>

<p>"You've been getting updates from Seville?  What the hell has been happening there?"</p>

<p>"Let's go somewhere that serves alcohol to discuss that.  My agents have told me of an excellent pub on Kattegat, and I hear the two of you have no need to pay for drinks on that world."</p>

<p>Of course the space traffic directors at Kattegat expected us to need the roof of the power station for a rolling landing, and they were surprised when we asked for a courtyard of modest dimensions in the city near a certain trendy address.  This was quickly arranged, and it was indeed about an hour after the Curator updated his relay that we touched down in a small vacant lot between two very Earthlike wooden buildings.  We walked around a few corners and found the pub.</p>

<p>Over large glasses of rich fermented beverage, the Curator told us what had happened after the inhibitor went online.  "Nearly all of the power failed, of course," he said.  "We get used to using the fold drop repeaters because, like hydroelectric, they work all the time.  But nanites can also make good photovoltaic and supercapacitor power storage stations.  The Sevillians knew their hardship was a punishment and did not waste time lamenting it.  They set about dismantling their now useless fold drop repeaters and building solar fields and batteries.  Most of the planet was without power for less than a year, and they managed to save that year's agricultural crops so there was no famine."</p>

<p>"I'm glad that there wasn't a lot of death," I said.</p>

<p>"Well the crews of the two orbiting foldships had no way home; as you now know the repulsor plating is fold based.  They said their goodbyes via radio and opened the airlocks.  And the leaders who had created the xenocide program were publicly tried and put to death.  The Sevillians had not imposed the death penalty for thousands of years but they found this particular crime a bit over the top.  And of course there were the minor tragedies you would expect as people found themselves in flying transports that could no longer fly and similar situations.  Still it was a very small percentage of their global population."</p>

<p>"Do you know what happened to K?"</p>

<p>"Not specifically, but I would be very surprised if it was not put to death with the rest of the would-be xenocides.  Our repeater doesn't have a lot of bandwidth.  It only functions at all about thirty percent of the time due to astrophysical alignments, and manages about ten bits per second best case when it does.  We're limited because our ground agents are pretending to be amateur radio operators, and don't have proper radio telescope dishes.  So we mostly get what amount to newspaper clippings."</p>

<p>"So what are things like now, four years later?" M asked.</p>

<p>"Sevillian civilization has mostly recovered from the insult.  They were a self-sufficient world before we gave them the fold and they are self-sufficient again now without it.  You may recall the elder gentlebeing who came down from the balcony to challenge us; it was their supreme leader many years ago and after we folded out it was reappointed by acclimation.  It led the trials of the xenocides and the organization of replacement networks for the infrastructure disabled by the fold inhibitor.  It also kept up awareness that a great wrong had been attempted in their name, for which they all had responsibility.  The result has been similar to the situation in your country of Germany after the unpleasantness of your second World War.  There is a subpopulation of die hards who would kill anything that disagrees with them on general principle, but they are a small minority and not generally tolerated.  The official and popular view is that they were betrayed by leaders who misled them and attempted to make them all agents of murder, and that this cannot ever be tolerated.  It will be interesting to see how well this attitude persists across future generations."</p>

<p>"I still think we are maybe being a bit too harsh making them live with it for a thousand years."</p>

<p>"Well it's done," the Curator said.  "How would you propose to disable it?  It's deep beneath the surface of an airless world shielded by the inhibitor itself.  If you get within two astronomical units of it your ship becomes a flying brick."</p>

<p>"Right."</p>

<p>We talked a bit more then made our way back to the ship, which was now surrounded by a small crowd of local raiders.  At our approach there was a collective "Ooooooh" and as we opened the hatch one of the kittens said, "How did you get it here?"</p>

<p>"You'll see very soon," M said mischievously.</p>

<p>"Thanks for saving our world," he added.  The secret hadn't lasted long.  Fortunately none of them recognized us as individuals.</p>

<p>"Just promise us that if you're ever in the position to do it for another people, you'll do the same yourselves."</p>

<p>At that the crowd did their stomping salute, and we stomped back as we'd learned to do on our first visit.  Then we closed the hatch and lifted off in perfect silence while they gaped, and in less than an hour we were back on Earth eating dinner.</p>
